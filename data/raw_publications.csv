31487867,Molecular Docking: Shifting Paradigms in Drug Discovery.,"Molecular docking is an established in silico structure-based method widely used in drug discovery. Docking enables the identification of novel compounds of therapeutic interest, predicting ligand-target interactions at a molecular level, or delineating structure-activity relationships (SAR), without knowing a priori the chemical structure of other target modulators. Although it was originally developed to help understanding the mechanisms of molecular recognition between small and large molecules, uses and applications of docking in drug discovery have heavily changed over the last years. In this review, we describe how molecular docking was firstly applied to assist in drug discovery tasks. Then, we illustrate newer and emergent uses and applications of docking, including prediction of adverse effects, polypharmacology, drug repurposing, and target fishing and profiling, discussing also future applications and further potential of this technique when combined with emergent techniques, such as artificial intelligence.",International journal of molecular sciences,2019

28809009,Docking and Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery.,"Stages in a typical drug discovery organization include target selection, hit identification, lead optimization, preclinical and clinical studies. Hit identification and lead optimization are very much intertwined with computational modeling. Structure-based virtual screening (VS) has been a staple for more than a decade now in drug discovery with its underlying computational technique, docking, extensively studied. Depending on the objective, the parameters for VS may change, but the overall protocol is very straightforward. The idea behind VS is that a library of small compounds are docked into the binding pocket of a protein (e.g., receptor, enzyme), a number of solutions per molecule, among the top-ranked, are being returned, and a choice is made on the fraction of compounds to be moved forward for testing toward hit identification. The underlying principle of VS is that it differentiates between active and inactive compounds, thus reducing the number of molecules moving forward and possibly offering a complementary tool to high-throughput screening (HTS). Best practices in library selection, target preparation and refinement, criteria in selecting the most appropriate docking/scoring scheme, and a step-wise approach in performing Glide VS are discussed.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2017

37702938,Automated Virtual Screening.,"Computational methods in modern drug discovery have become ubiquitous, with methods that cover most of the discovery stages: from hit finding and lead identification to lead optimization. The overall aim of these computational methods is to obtain a more efficient discovery process, by reducing the number of ""wet"" experiments required to produce therapeutics that have higher probability of succeeding in clinical development and subsequently benefitting end patients by developing highly effective therapeutics having minimal side effects. Virtual Screening is usually applied at the early stage of drug discovery, looking to find chemical matter having desired properties, such as molecular shape, electrostatics, and pharmacophores at desired three-dimensional positions. The aim of this stage is to search in a wide chemical space, including chemistry available from commercial suppliers and virtual databases of predicted reaction products, to identify molecules that would exert a particular biochemical response. This initial stage of the discovery process is very important since the subsequent stages will use the initial chemical motifs that have been found at the hit finding stage, and therefore the most suitable the compound is found, the more likely it is that subsequent stages will be successful and less time and resource consuming. This chapter provides a summary of various Virtual Screening methods, including shape match and molecular docking, and these methods are used in a Virtual Screening workflow that is provided as an example which is described to be run automatically in cloud resources. This automatic in-depth exploration of the chemical space using validated Virtual Screening methods can lead to a more streamlined and efficient discovery process, aiming to deliver chemical matter of high quality and maximizing the required biological effects while minimizing adverse effects.

Building on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of drug-like molecules and gene knockdowns, ceSAR combines cheminformatic techniques with signature concordance analysis to connect small molecules and their targets and further assess their biophysical compatibility using molecular docking. Candidate compounds are first ranked in a target structure-independent manner, using chemical similarity to LINCS analogs that exhibit transcriptomic concordance with a target gene knockdown. Top candidates are subsequently rescored using docking simulations and machine learning-based consensus of the two approaches. Using extensive benchmarking, we show that ceSAR greatly reduces false-positive rates, while cutting run times by multiple orders of magnitude and further democratizing drug discovery pipelines.

Among these techniques, high-throughput molecular docking has proved to be extremely useful in identifying novel bioactive compounds within large chemical libraries. In the docking procedure, the predominant binding mode of each small molecule within a target binding site is assessed, and a docking score reflective of the likelihood of binding is assigned to them. These methods also shed light on how a given hit could be modified in order to improve protein-ligand interactions and are thus able to guide lead optimization. The possibility of reducing time and cost compared to experimental approaches made this technology highly appealing. Due to methodological developments and the increase of computational power, the application of quantum mechanical methods to study macromolecular systems has gained substantial attention in the last decade. A quantum mechanical description of the interactions involved in molecular association of biomolecules may lead to better accuracy compared to molecular mechanics, since there are many physical phenomena that cannot be correctly described within a classical framework, such as covalent bond formation, polarization effects, charge transfer, bond rearrangements, halogen bonding, and others, that require electrons to be explicitly accounted for.

26313123,Flexible receptor docking for drug discovery.,"INTRODUCTION: Molecular docking has become a popular method for virtual screening. Docking small molecules to a rigid biological receptor is fast but could produce many false negatives and identify less diverse compounds. Flexible receptor docking has alleviated this problem. AREAS COVERED: This article focuses on reviewing ensemble docking as an approximate but inexpensive method to incorporate receptor flexibility in molecular docking. It outlines key features and recent advances of this method and points out problem areas that need to be addressed to make it even more useful in drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: Among the different methods introduced for flexible receptor docking, ensemble docking represents one of the most popular approaches, especially for high-throughput virtual screening. One can generate structural ensembles by using experimental structures, by structural modeling and by various types of molecular simulations. In building a structural ensemble, a judicious choice of the structures to be included can improve performance. Furthermore, reducing the size of the structural ensemble can cut computational costs, and removing the structures that can bind few ligands well could enrich the number of true actives identified by ensemble docking. The ability of ensemble docking to identify more true positives at the top of a rank-ordered list also depends on the choice of the methods to score and rank compounds, an area that needs further research.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2015

Therefore, integrating computational and experimental strategies into the studies on molecular targets essential for the survival and virulence of the parasite is fundamental in researching and developing new treatments for leishmaniasis. In the effort to develop new vaccines and drugs, molecular docking methods are widely used as they explore the adopted conformations of small molecules within the binding sites of macromolecular targets and estimate the free energy of target-ligand binding. Privileged structures have been widely used as an effective model in medicinal chemistry for drug discovery. Chalcones are a common simple scaffold found in many compounds of natural and synthetic origin, where studies demonstrate the great pharmacological potential in treating leishmaniasis. This review is based on scientific articles published in the last ten years on molecular docking of chalcone derivatives for essential molecular targets of Leishmania. Thus, this review emphasizes how versatile chalcone derivatives can be used in developing new inhibitors of important molecular targets involved in the survival, growth, cell differentiation, and infectivity of the parasites that cause leishmaniasis.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2023
26156197,The Dynamics of Drug Discovery.,"Proteins are not static objects. To carry out their functions in the cells and participate in biochemical interaction networks, proteins have to explore different conformational substates, which favor the adaptation to different partners and ultimately allow them to respond to changes in the environment. In this paper we discuss the implications of including the atomistic description of protein dynamics and flexibility in the context of drug discovery and design. The underlying idea is that a better understanding of the atomistic details of molecular recognition phenomena and conformational cross-talk between a ligand and a receptor can in fact translate in unexplored opportunities for the discovery of new drug like molecules. We will illustrate and discuss dynamics-based pharmacophores, the discovery of cryptic binding sites, the characterization and exploitation of allosteric regulation mechanisms and the definition of potential protein-protein interaction sites as potential sources of new bases for the rational design of small molecules endowed with specific biological functions. Overall, the inclusion of protein flexibility in the drug discovery process is starting to attract attention not only in the academic but also in the industrial community. This is supported by experimental tests that prove the actual feasibility of considering the explicit dynamics of drug-protein interactions at all relevant levels of resolution and the use of multiple receptor conformations in drug discovery, as affordable complements (if not an alternative) to classical High Throughput Screening (HTS) efforts based on static structures.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2015
29934900,Ion Channels in Drug Discovery and Safety Pharmacology.,"Ion channels are membrane proteins involved in almost all physiological processes, including neurotransmission, muscle contraction, pace-making activity, secretion, electrolyte and water balance, immune response, and cell proliferation. Due to their broad distribution in human body and physiological roles, ion channels are attractive targets for drug discovery and safety pharmacology. Over the years ion channels have been associated to many genetic diseases (""channelopathies""). For most of these diseases the therapy is mainly empirical and symptomatic, often limited by lack of efficacy and tolerability for a number of patients. The search for the development of new and more specific therapeutic approaches is therefore strongly pursued. At the same time acquired channelopathies or dangerous side effects (such as proarrhythmic risk) can develop as a consequence of drugs unexpectedly targeting ion channels. Several noncardiovascular drugs are known to block cardiac ion channels, leading to potentially fatal delayed ventricular repolarization. Thus, the search of reliable preclinical cardiac safety testing in early stage of drug discovery is mandatory. To fulfill these needs, both ion channels drug discovery and toxicology strategies are evolving toward comprehensive research approaches integrating ad hoc designed in silico predictions and experimental studies for a more reliable and quick translation of results to the clinic side.Here we discuss two examples of how the combination of in silico methods and patch clamp experiments can help addressing drug discovery and safety issues regarding ion channels.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018
35426249,Machine learning approaches and their applications in drug discovery and design.,"This review is focused on several machine learning approaches used in chemoinformatics. Machine learning approaches provide tools and algorithms to improve drug discovery. Many physicochemical properties of drugs like toxicity, absorption, drug-drug interaction, carcinogenesis, and distribution have been effectively modeled by QSAR techniques. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, and this technique has shown tremendous potential in the field of drug discovery. Techniques discussed in this review are capable of modeling non-linear datasets, as well as big data of increasing depth and complexity.

38031798,Recent Trends in Computer-aided Drug Design for Anti-cancer Drug Discovery.,"Cancer is considered one of the deadliest diseases globally, and continuous research is being carried out to find novel potential therapies for myriad cancer types that affect the human body. Researchers are hunting for innovative remedies to minimize the toxic effects of conventional therapies being driven by cancer, which is emerging as pivotal causes of mortality worldwide. Cancer progression steers the formation of heterogeneous behavior, including self-sustaining proliferation, malignancy, and evasion of apoptosis, tissue invasion, and metastasis of cells inside the tumor with distinct molecular features. The complexity of cancer therapeutics demands advanced approaches to comprehend the underlying mechanisms and potential therapies. Precision medicine and cancer therapies both rely on drug discovery. In vitro drug screening and in vivo animal trials are the mainstays of traditional approaches for drug development; however, both techniques are laborious and expensive. Omics data explosion in the last decade has made it possible to discover efficient anti-cancer drugs via computational drug discovery approaches. Computational techniques such as computer-aided drug design have become an essential drug discovery tool and a keystone for novel drug development methods. In this review, we seek to provide an overview of computational drug discovery procedures comprising the target sites prediction, drug discovery based on structure and ligand-based design, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), molecular docking calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations with a focus on cancer therapeutics.

The current advancements in computer-aided drug discovery and design targeting ion channels are summarized. First, ligand-based studies for drug design are briefly outlined. Then, we focus on the structurebased studies targeting pore domains, endogenous binding sites and allosteric sites of ion channels. Moreover, we also review the contribution of computational methods to the field of ligand binding and unbinding pathways of ion channels. Finally, we propose future developments for the field.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2016
28205401,Computer-aided drug design to explore cyclodextrin therapeutics and biomedical applications.,"Cyclodextrin (CD) is a subset of the macrocyclic structural class, which is an important class of small organic agents that are useful functional excipients. They have wide range application possibilities in different fields of sciences such as material preparation, medicine, analytical chemistry, and separation processes. They are used widely in pharmaceutical formulations and drug delivery for increasing the water solubility of low soluble drugs and drug candidates. Due to the ring structure, they behave differently than smaller molecules and may be capable of hitting new classes of targets. A macrocyclic molecule presents varied functionality and stereochemical complexity in a pre-organized conformation of the ring structure. This can result in high selectivity and affinity for protein targets while conserving enough bioavailability to arrive at intracellular locations. Regardless of these valuable features, and the verified success of several marketed macrocycle drugs isolated from natural compounds, this class has been little explored in drug development. This study describes some of the key features of the CDs therapeutic discovery. Also, the application of computational chemistry approaches such as QSAR/QSPR, molecular docking, and molecular/quantum mechanics for modeling of CD-drug system is reviewed briefly.",Chemical biology & drug design,2017

We show high performance of VideoMol in predicting molecular targets and properties across 43 drug discovery benchmark datasets. VideoMol achieves high accuracy in identifying antiviral molecules against common diverse disease-specific drug targets (i.e., BACE1 and EP4).

37175316,"Past, Present, and Future Perspectives on Computer-Aided Drug Design Methodologies.","The application of computational approaches in drug discovery has been consolidated in the last decades. These families of techniques are usually grouped under the common name of ""computer-aided drug design"" (CADD), and they now constitute one of the pillars in the pharmaceutical discovery pipelines in many academic and industrial environments. Their implementation has been demonstrated to tremendously improve the speed of the early discovery steps, allowing for the proficient and rational choice of proper compounds for a desired therapeutic need among the extreme vastness of the drug-like chemical space. Moreover, the application of CADD approaches allows the rationalization of biochemical and interactive processes of pharmaceutical interest at the molecular level. Because of this, computational tools are now extensively used also in the field of rational 3D design and optimization of chemical entities starting from the structural information of the targets, which can be experimentally resolved or can also be obtained with other computer-based techniques. In this work, we revised the state-of-the-art computer-aided drug design methods, focusing on their application in different scenarios of pharmaceutical and biological interest, not only highlighting their great potential and their benefits, but also discussing their actual limitations and eventual weaknesses.

34885952,Virtual Screening with Gnina 1.0.,"Virtual screening-predicting which compounds within a specified compound library bind to a target molecule, typically a protein-is a fundamental task in the field of drug discovery. Doing virtual screening well provides tangible practical benefits, including reduced drug development costs, faster time to therapeutic viability, and fewer unforeseen side effects. As with most applied computational tasks, the algorithms currently used to perform virtual screening feature inherent tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, even theoretically rigorous, computationally intensive methods may fail to account for important effects relevant to whether a given compound will ultimately be usable as a drug. Here we investigate the virtual screening performance of the recently released Gnina molecular docking software, which uses deep convolutional networks to score protein-ligand structures. We find, on average, that Gnina outperforms conventional empirical scoring. The default scoring in Gnina outperforms the empirical AutoDock Vina scoring function on 89 of the 117 targets of the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA virtual screening benchmarks with a median 1% early enrichment factor that is more than twice that of Vina. However, we also find that issues of bias linger in these sets, even when not used directly to train models, and this bias obfuscates to what extent machine learning models are achieving their performance through a sophisticated interpretation of molecular interactions versus fitting to non-informative simplistic property distributions.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
27186904,Using reverse docking for target identification and its applications for drug discovery.,"INTRODUCTION: In contrast to traditional molecular docking, inverse or reverse docking is used for identifying receptors for a given ligand among a large number of receptors. Reverse docking can be used to discover new targets for existing drugs and natural compounds, explain polypharmacology and the molecular mechanism of a substance, find alternative indications of drugs through drug repositioning, and detecting adverse drug reactions and drug toxicity. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors examine how reverse docking methods have evolved over the past fifteen years and how they have been used for target identification and related applications for drug discovery. They discuss various aspects of target databases, reverse docking tools and servers. EXPERT OPINION: There are several issues related to reverse docking methods such as target structure dataset construction, computational efficiency, how to include receptor flexibility, and most importantly, how to properly normalize the docking scores. In order for reverse docking to become a truly useful tool for the drug discovery, these issues need to be adequately resolved.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2016
35849793,DOCKSTRING: Easy Molecular Docking Yields Better Benchmarks for Ligand Design.,"The field of machine learning for drug discovery is witnessing an explosion of novel methods. These methods are often benchmarked on simple physicochemical properties such as solubility or general druglikeness, which can be readily computed. However, these properties are poor representatives of objective functions in drug design, mainly because they do not depend on the candidate compound's interaction with the target. By contrast, molecular docking is a widely applied method in drug discovery to estimate binding affinities. However, docking studies require a significant amount of domain knowledge to set up correctly, which hampers adoption. Here, we present dockstring, a bundle for meaningful and robust comparison of ML models using docking scores. dockstring consists of three components: (1) an open-source Python package for straightforward computation of docking scores, (2) an extensive dataset of docking scores and poses of more than 260,000 molecules for 58 medically relevant targets, and (3) a set of pharmaceutically relevant benchmark tasks such as virtual screening or de novo design of selective kinase inhibitors. The Python package implements a robust ligand and target preparation protocol that allows nonexperts to obtain meaningful docking scores. Our dataset is the first to include docking poses, as well as the first of its size that is a full matrix, thus facilitating experiments in multiobjective optimization and transfer learning. Overall, our results indicate that docking scores are a more realistic evaluation objective than simple physicochemical properties, yielding benchmark tasks that are more challenging and more closely related to real problems in drug discovery.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022
25420726,Fragment-based drug discovery and molecular docking in drug design.,"Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has caused a revolution in the process of drug discovery and design, with many FBDD leads being developed into clinical trials or approved in the past few years. Compared with traditional high-throughput screening, it displays obvious advantages such as efficiently covering chemical space, achieving higher hit rates, and so forth. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments of FBDD for improving drug discovery, illustrating the process and the importance of FBDD. In particular, the computational strategies applied in the process of FBDD and molecular-docking programs are highlighted elaborately.

35566391,Accelerating AutoDock Vina with GPUs.,"AutoDock Vina is one of the most popular molecular docking tools. In the latest benchmark CASF-2016 for comparative assessment of scoring functions, AutoDock Vina won the best docking power among all the docking tools. Modern drug discovery is facing a common scenario of large virtual screening of drug hits from huge compound databases. Due to the seriality characteristic of the AutoDock Vina algorithm, there is no successful report on its parallel acceleration with GPUs. Current acceleration of AutoDock Vina typically relies on the stack of computing power as well as the allocation of resource and tasks, such as the VirtualFlow platform. The vast resource expenditure and the high access threshold of users will greatly limit the popularity of AutoDock Vina and the flexibility of its usage in modern drug discovery. In this work, we proposed a new method, Vina-GPU, for accelerating AutoDock Vina with GPUs, which is greatly needed for reducing the investment for large virtual screens and also for wider application in large-scale virtual screening on personal computers, station servers or cloud computing, etc. Our proposed method is based on a modified Monte Carlo using simulating annealing AI algorithm. It greatly raises the number of initial random conformations and reduces the search depth of each thread. Moreover, a classic optimizer named BFGS is adopted to optimize the ligand conformations during the docking progress, before a heterogeneous OpenCL implementation was developed to realize its parallel acceleration leveraging thousands of GPU cores. Large benchmark tests show that Vina-GPU reaches an average of 21-fold and a maximum of 50-fold docking acceleration against the original AutoDock Vina while ensuring their comparable docking accuracy, indicating its potential for pushing the popularization of AutoDock Vina in large virtual screens.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022

29188568,Opportunities and Challenges in the Discovery of Allosteric Modulators of GPCRs.,"From the pharmacological point of view, allosteric modulators may present numerous advantages over orthosteric ligands. Growing availability of novel tools and experimental data provides a tempting opportunity to apply computational methods to improve known modulators and design novel ones. However, recent progress in understanding of complexity of allostery increases awareness of problems involved in design of modulators with desired properties. Deeper insight into phenomena such as probe dependence, altering signaling bias with minor changes in ligand structure, as well as influence of subtle endogenous allosteric factors turns out to be fundamental. These effects make the design of a modulator with precise pharmacological outcome a very challenging task, and need to be taken into consideration throughout the design process. In this chapter, we focus on nuances of targeting GPCR allosteric sites in computational drug design efforts, in particular with application of docking, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018

29165360,Dynamic Docking: A Paradigm Shift in Computational Drug Discovery.,"Molecular docking is the methodology of choice for studying in silico protein-ligand binding and for prioritizing compounds to discover new lead candidates. Traditional docking simulations suffer from major limitations, mostly related to the static or semi-flexible treatment of ligands and targets. They also neglect solvation and entropic effects, which strongly limits their predictive power. During the last decade, methods based on full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) have emerged as a valid alternative for simulating macromolecular complexes. In principle, compared to traditional docking, MD allows the full exploration of drug-target recognition and binding from both the mechanistic and energetic points of view (dynamic docking). Binding and unbinding kinetic constants can also be determined. While dynamic docking is still too computationally expensive to be routinely used in fast-paced drug discovery programs, the advent of faster computing architectures and advanced simulation methodologies are changing this scenario. It is feasible that dynamic docking will replace static docking approaches in the near future, leading to a major paradigm shift in in silico drug discovery. Against this background, we review the key achievements that have paved the way for this progress.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2017

29376444,Hot-spot analysis for drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions.,"Protein-protein interactions are important for biological processes and pathological situations, and are attractive targets for drug discovery. However, rational drug design targeting protein-protein interactions is still highly challenging. Hot-spot residues are seen as the best option to target such interactions, but their identification requires detailed structural and energetic characterization, which is only available for a tiny fraction of protein interactions. Areas covered: In this review, the authors cover a variety of computational methods that have been reported for the energetic analysis of protein-protein interfaces in search of hot-spots, and the structural modeling of protein-protein complexes by docking. This can help to rationalize the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interfaces of therapeutic interest. Computational analysis and docking can help to locate the interface, molecular dynamics can be used to find suitable cavities, and hot-spot predictions can focus the search for inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. Expert opinion: A major difficulty for applying rational drug design methods to protein-protein interactions is that in the majority of cases the complex structure is not available. Fortunately, computational docking can complement experimental data. An interesting aspect to explore in the future is the integration of these strategies for targeting PPIs with large-scale mutational analysis.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2018
31025886,The compromise of virtual screening and its impact on drug discovery.,"Introduction: Docking and structure-based virtual screening (VS) have been standard approaches in structure-based design for over two decades. However, our understanding of the limitations, potential, and strength of these techniques has enhanced, raising expectations. Areas covered: Based on a survey of reports in the past five years, we assess whether VS: (1) predicts binding poses in agreement with crystallographic data (when available); (2) is a superior screening tool, as often claimed; (3) is successful in identifying chemical scaffolds that can be starting points for subsequent lead optimization cycles. Data shows that knowledge of the target and its chemotypes in postprocessing lead to viable hits in early drug discovery endeavors. Expert opinion: VS is capable of accurate placements in the pocket for the most part, but does not consistently score screening collections accurately. What matters is capitalization on available resources to get closer to a viable lead or optimizable series. Integration of approaches, subjective hit selection guided by knowledge of the receptor or endogenous ligand, libraries driven by experimental guides, validation studies to identify the best docking/scoring that reproduces experimental findings, constraints regarding receptor-ligand interactions, thoroughly designed methodologies, and predefined cutoff scoring criteria strengthen VS's position in pharmaceutical research.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2019

Fluoroquinolones have been shown to inhibit HCV replication by targeting HCV NS3-helicase. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that natural analogs of fluoroquinolones will have similar or superior inhibitory potential while having potentially fewer adverse effects. METHODS: To screen for natural analogs of fluoroquinolones, we devised an integrated in silico Cheminformatics-Molecular Docking approach. We used 17 fluoroquinolones as bait reference, to screen large databases of natural analogs. 10399 natural compounds and their derivatives were retrieved from the databases. From these compounds, molecules bearing physicochemical similarities with fluoroquinolones were analyzed using a cheminformatics-docking approach. RESULTS: From the 10399 compounds screened using our cheminformatics approach, only 20 compounds were found to share physicochemical similarities with fluoroquinolones, while the remaining 10379 compounds were physiochemically different from fluoroquinolones. Molecular docking analysis showed 32 amino acids in the HCV NS3 active site that were most frequently targeted by fluoroquinolones and their natural analogues, indicating a functional similarity between the two groups of compounds.

This information is extremely valuable for the development of new therapeutic agents that promote desired conformational receptor states and responses while avoiding the ones leading to undesired side-effects.This book chapter intends to introduce the reader to powerful computational approaches for sampling the conformational space of these receptors, focusing first on molecular dynamics and the analysis of the produced data through methods such as dimensionality reduction, Markov State Models and adaptive sampling. Then, we show how to seek for compounds that target distinct conformational states via docking and virtual screening. In addition, we describe how to detect receptor-ligand interactions that drive signaling bias and comment current challenges and opportunities of presented methods.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018

25633330,Theory and applications of covalent docking in drug discovery: merits and pitfalls.,"he present art of drug discovery and design of new drugs is based on suicidal irreversible inhibitors. Covalent inhibition is the strategy that is used to achieve irreversible inhibition. Irreversible inhibitors interact with their targets in a time-dependent fashion, and the reaction proceeds to completion rather than to equilibrium. Covalent inhibitors possessed some significant advantages over non-covalent inhibitors such as covalent warheads can target rare, non-conserved residue of a particular target protein and thus led to development of highly selective inhibitors, covalent inhibitors can be effective in targeting proteins with shallow binding cleavage which will led to development of novel inhibitors with increased potency than non-covalent inhibitors. Several computational approaches have been developed to simulate covalent interactions; however, this is still a challenging area to explore. Covalent molecular docking has been recently implemented in the computer-aided drug design workflows to describe covalent interactions between inhibitors and biological targets. In this review we highlight: (i) covalent interactions in biomolecular systems; (ii) the mathematical framework of covalent molecular docking; (iii) implementation of covalent docking protocol in drug design workflows; (iv) applications covalent docking: case studies and (v) shortcomings and future perspectives of covalent docking. To the best of our knowledge; this review is the first account that highlights different aspects of covalent docking with its merits and pitfalls. We believe that the method and applications highlighted in this study will help future efforts towards the design of irreversible inhibitors.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2015

28802714,In silico structure-based approaches to discover protein-protein interaction-targeting drugs.,"A core concept behind modern drug discovery is finding a small molecule that modulates a function of a target protein. This concept has been successfully applied since the mid-1970s. However, the efficiency of drug discovery is decreasing because the druggable target space in the human proteome is limited. Recently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) has been identified asan emerging target space for drug discovery. PPI plays a pivotal role in biological pathways including diseases. Current human interactome research suggests that the number of PPIs is between 130,000 and 650,000, and only a small number of them have been targeted as drug targets. For traditional drug targets, in silico structure-based methods have been successful in many cases. However, their performance suffers on PPI interfaces because PPI interfaces are different in five major aspects: From a geometric standpoint, they have relatively large interface regions, flat geometry, and the interface surface shape tends to fluctuate upon binding. Also, their interactions are dominated by hydrophobic atoms, which is different from traditional binding-pocket-targeted drugs. Finally, PPI targets usually lack natural molecules that bind to the target PPI interface. Here, we first summarize characteristics of PPI interfaces and their known binders. Then, we will review existing in silico structure-based approaches for discovering small molecules that bind to PPI interfaces.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2017

Several structure-based methods have been developed at different levels of approximation. Among them, molecular docking is an established technique with high efficiency, but typically low accuracy. Moreover, docking performances are known to be target-dependent, which makes the choice of the docking program and corresponding scoring function critical when approaching a new protein target. To compare the performances of different docking protocols, we developed ChemFlow_py, an automated tool to perform docking and rescoring. Using four protein systems extracted from DUD-E with 100 known active compounds and 3000 decoys per target, we compared the performances of several rescoring strategies including consensus scoring. We found that the average docking results can be improved by consensus ranking, which emphasizes the relevance of consensus scoring when little or no chemical information is available for a given target.

Recently, a small-molecule inhibitor of CD38 was shown to slow down pathways relating to aging and DNA damage. We examined the performance of seven docking programs for their ability to model protein-ligand interactions with CD38. A test set of twelve CD38 crystal structures, containing crystallized biologically relevant substrates, were used to assess pose prediction. The rankings for each program based on the median RMSD between the native and predicted were Vina, AD4 > PLANTS, Gold, Glide, Molegro > rDock. Forty-two compounds with known affinities were docked to assess the accuracy of the programs at affinity/ranking predictions. The rankings based on scoring power were: Vina, PLANTS > Glide, Gold > Molegro >> AutoDock 4 >> rDock. Out of the top four performing programs, Glide had the only scoring function that did not appear to show bias towards overpredicting the affinity of the ligand-based on its size. Factors that affect the reliability of pose prediction and scoring are discussed. General limitations and known biases of scoring functions are examined, aided in part by using molecular fingerprints and Random Forest classifiers. This machine learning approach may be used to systematically diagnose molecular features that are correlated with poor scoring accuracy.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020

Despite extensive research, its complex etiology remains elusive, necessitating new treatments. This study utilized machine learning (ML) to analyze compounds with neuroprotective potential. This approach exposed the disease's complexity and identified important proteins, namely MTOR and BCL2, as central to the pathogenic network of AD. MTOR regulates neuronal autophagy and survival, whereas BCL2 regulates apoptosis, both of which are disrupted in AD.

The potential for synergistic effects of these drugs in treating AD has been revealed via network pharmacology. By targeting numerous proteins at once, these chemicals may provide a more comprehensive therapeutic approach, addressing many aspects of AD's complex pathophysiology. A Molecular docking, dynamic simulation, and Principle Component Analysis have confirmed these drugs' efficacy by establishing substantial binding affinities and interactions with important proteins such as MTOR and BCL2. This evidence implies that various compounds may interact within the AD pathological framework, providing a sophisticated and multifaceted therapy strategy. In conclusion, our study establishes a solid foundation for the use of these drugs in AD therapy. Thus current study highlights the possibility of multi-targeted, synergistic therapeutic approaches in addressing the complex pathophysiology of AD by integrating machine learning, network pharmacology, and molecular docking simulations.

In drug discovery, predicting bioactivity streamlines early-stage candidate screening by swiftly identifying potential active molecules. The popular deep learning methods in bioactivity prediction primarily model the ligand structure-bioactivity relationship under the premise of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR). However, bioactivity is determined by multiple factors, including not only the ligand structure but also drug-target interactions, signaling pathways, reaction environments, pharmacokinetic properties, and species differences. Our study first integrates drug-target interactions into bioactivity prediction using protein-ligand complex data from molecular docking. We devise a Drug-Target Interaction Graph Neural Network (DTIGN), infusing interatomic forces into intermolecular graphs. DTIGN employs multi-head self-attention to identify native-like binding pockets and poses within molecular docking results. To validate the fidelity of the self-attention mechanism, we gather ground truth data from crystal structure databases. Subsequently, we employ these limited native structures to refine bioactivity prediction via semi-supervised learning. For this study, we establish a unique benchmark dataset for evaluating bioactivity prediction models in the context of protein-ligand complexes, showcasing the superior performance of our method (with an average improvement of 27.03%) through comparison with 9 leading deep learning-based bioactivity prediction methods.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2024

The goal of this review is to discuss the definition, detection, and druggability of such sites, and their potential value for drug discovery. Novel methods based on molecular dynamics simulations are particularly promising and yield a large number of transient pockets, but it has been shown that only a minority of such sites are generally capable of binding ligands with substantial affinity. Based on recent studies, current methodology can be improved by combining molecular dynamics with fragment docking and machine learning approaches.",Current opinion in chemical biology,2018
39550439,Deep learning pipeline for accelerating virtual screening in drug discovery.,"In the race to combat ever-evolving diseases, the drug discovery process often faces the hurdles of high-cost and time-consuming procedures. To tackle these challenges and enhance the efficiency of identifying new therapeutic agents, we introduce VirtuDockDL, which is a streamlined Python-based web platform utilizing deep learning for drug discovery. This pipeline employs a Graph Neural Network to analyze and predict the effectiveness of various compounds as potential drug candidates. During the validation phase, VirtuDockDL was instrumental in identifying non-covalent inhibitors against the VP35 protein of the Marburg virus, a critical target given the virus's high fatality rate and limited treatment options. Further, in benchmarking, VirtuDockDL achieved 99% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.992, and an AUC of 0.99 on the HER2 dataset, surpassing DeepChem (89% accuracy) and AutoDock Vina (82% accuracy). Compared to RosettaVS, MzDOCK, and PyRMD, VirtuDockDL outperformed them by combining both ligand- and structure-based screening with deep learning. While RosettaVS excels in accurate docking but lacks high-throughput screening, and PyRMD focuses on ligand-based methods without AI integration, VirtuDockDL offers superior predictive accuracy and full automation for large-scale datasets, making it ideal for comprehensive drug discovery workflows. These results underscore the tool's capability to identify high-affinity inhibitors accurately across various targets, including the HER2 protein for cancer therapy, TEM-1 beta-lactamase for bacterial infections, and the CYP51 enzyme for fungal infections like Candidiasis. To sum up, VirtuDockDL combines user-friendly interface design with powerful computational capabilities to facilitate rapid, cost-effective drug discovery and development. The integration of AI in drug discovery could potentially transform the landscape of pharmaceutical research, providing faster responses to global health challenges.

31709196,Drug Discovery and Repurposing Inhibits a Major Gut Pathogen-Derived Oncogenic Toxin.,"Objective: The human intestinal microbiome plays an important role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) development. One of the first discovered bacterial mediators involves Bacteroides fragilis toxin (BFT, also named as fragilysin), a metalloprotease encoded by enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) that causes barrier disruption and inflammation of the colon, leads to tumorigenesis in susceptible mice, and is enriched in the mucosa of IBD and CRC patients. Thus, targeted inhibition of BFT may benefit ETBF carrying patients. Design: By applying two complementary in silico drug design techniques, drug repositioning and molecular docking, we predicted potential BFT inhibitory compounds. Top candidates were tested in vitro on the CRC epithelial cell line HT29/c1 for their potential to inhibit key aspects of BFT activity, being epithelial morphology changes, E-cadherin cleavage (a marker for barrier function) and increased IL-8 secretion. Results: The primary bile acid and existing drug chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), currently used for treating gallstones, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, and constipation, was found to significantly inhibit all evaluated cell responses to BFT exposure. The inhibition of BFT resulted from a direct interaction between CDCA and BFT, as confirmed by an increase in the melting temperature of the BFT protein in the presence of CDCA. Conclusion: Together, our results show the potential of in silico drug discovery to combat harmful human and microbiome-derived proteins and more specifically suggests a potential for retargeting CDCA to inhibit the pro-oncogenic toxin BFT.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019

36655529,CYP1B1: A Promising Target in Cancer Drug Discovery.,"CYP1B1 plays an essential role in cancer's pathogenesis since it activates procarcinogens. Significantly, this enzyme catalyzes the hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol, leading to carcinogenic metabolites involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Therefore, the inhibition of CYP1B1 activity is considered a therapeutic target for chemotherapy. In addition, CYP1B1 is overexpressed in hormone-dependent cancer cells and could be related to resistance to anticancer drugs. However, the activity of CYP1B1 in the tumor microenvironment can metabolize and activate prodrugs in cancer cells, providing more selectivity and being useful for chemoprevention or chemotherapy strategies. Furthermore, due to its importance in anticancer drug design, recent studies have reported using computational methods to understand the intermolecular interactions between possible ligands and CYP1B1. Therefore, in this perspective, we highlight recent findings in developing CYP1B1 inhibitors (flavonoids, trans-stilbenes, estradiol derivatives, and carbazoles) and CYP1B1-activated prodrugs (a chalcone DMU-135 and an oxime DMAKO-20). Finally, we have analyzed their possible molecular interactions with this enzymatic target by molecular docking, which can help to design new active substances.",Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,2023
30597997,Therapeutic Inhibition of Myc in Cancer. Structural Bases and Computer-Aided Drug Discovery Approaches.,"Myc (avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) represents one of the most sought after drug targets in cancer. Myc transcription factor is an essential regulator of cell growth, but in most cancers it is overexpressed and associated with treatment-resistance and lethal outcomes. Over 40 years of research and drug development efforts did not yield a clinically useful Myc inhibitor. Drugging the ""undruggable"" is problematic, as Myc inactivation may negatively impact its physiological functions. Moreover, Myc is a disordered protein that lacks effective binding pockets on its surface. It is well established that the Myc function is dependent on dimerization with its obligate partner, Max (Myc associated factor X), which together form a functional DNA-binding domain to activate genomic targets. Herein, we provide an overview of the knowledge accumulated to date on Myc regulation and function, its critical role in cancer, and summarize various strategies that are employed to tackle Myc-driven malignant transformation. We focus on important structure-function relationships of Myc with its interactome, elaborating structural determinants of Myc-Max dimer formation and DNA recognition exploited for therapeutic inhibition. Chronological development of small-molecule Myc-Max prototype inhibitors and corresponding binding sites are comprehensively reviewed and particular emphasis is placed on modern computational drug design methods. On the outlook, technological advancements may soon provide the so long-awaited Myc-Max clinical candidate.",International journal of molecular sciences,2018

30024079,Arylfluorosulfate-Based Electrophiles for Covalent Protein Labeling: A New Addition to the Arsenal.,"Selective covalent modification of a targeted protein is a powerful tool in chemical biology and drug discovery, with applications ranging from identification and characterization of proteins and their functions to the development of targeted covalent inhibitors. Most covalent ligands contain an affinity motif and an electrophilic warhead that reacts with a nucleophilic residue of the targeted protein. Because the electrophilic warhead is prone to react and modify off-target nucleophiles, its reactivity should be balanced carefully to maximize target selectivity. Arylfluorosulfates have recently emerged as latent electrophiles for selective labeling of context-specific tyrosine and lysine residues in protein pockets. Here, we review the recent but intense introduction of arylfluorosulfates into the arsenal of available warheads for selective covalent modification of proteins. We highlight the untapped potential of this functional group for use in chemical biology and drug discovery.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019

Over 80 NR-targeting drugs have been approved for 18 NRs. The focus of drug discovery in NRs has hitherto been on identifying ligands that bind to the canonical ligand binding pockets of the C-terminal ligand binding domains (LBDs). Due to the development of drug resistance and selectivity concerns, there has been considerable interest in exploring other, non-canonical ligand binding sites. Unfortunately, the potencies of compounds binding at other sites have generally not been sufficient for clinical development. However, the situation has changed dramatically over the last 3years, as compounds with sufficient potency have been reported for several NR targets.

Although there is great interest in developing small molecule-based drugs with BTK inhibition, there are only a few drugs available in the market, due to the difficulty of drug discovery and the potential side effects. To select suitable drug compounds to inhibit BTK signaling, molecular drug screening bioassay processes of single ginsenosides integrated with in silico molecular simulation were performed. The experimental results for the ginsenoside compositions (Rb2 and Rb3) exhibited showed that they effectively suppressed the activity of BTK expression in a rational agreement with molecular docking calculations of the compounds against the BTK binding site.

36764832,Dockey: a modern integrated tool for large-scale molecular docking and virtual screening.,"Molecular docking is a structure-based and computer-aided drug design approach that plays a pivotal role in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research. AutoDock is the most widely used molecular docking tool for study of protein-ligand interactions and virtual screening. Although many tools have been developed to streamline and automate the AutoDock docking pipeline, some of them still use outdated graphical user interfaces and have not been updated for a long time. Meanwhile, some of them lack cross-platform compatibility and evaluation metrics for screening lead compound candidates. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Dockey, a flexible and intuitive graphical interface tool with seamless integration of several useful tools, which implements a complete docking pipeline covering molecular sanitization, molecular preparation, paralleled docking execution, interaction detection and conformation visualization. Specifically, Dockey can detect the non-covalent interactions between small molecules and proteins and perform cross-docking between multiple receptors and ligands. It has the capacity to automatically dock thousands of ligands to multiple receptors and analyze the corresponding docking results in parallel. All the generated data will be kept in a project file that can be shared between any systems and computers with the pre-installation of Dockey. We anticipate that these unique characteristics will make it attractive for researchers to conduct large-scale molecular docking without complicated operations, particularly for beginners.

33759126,Fragment-Based Drug Design of Selective HDAC6 Inhibitors.,"Medicinal chemistry society has enough arguments to justify the usage of fragment-based drug design (FBDD) methodologies for the identification of lead compounds. Since the FDA approval of three kinase inhibitors - vemurafenib, venetoclax, and erdafitinib, FBDD has become a challenging alternative to high-throughput screening methods in drug discovery. The following protocol presents in silico drug design of selective histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors through a fragment-based approach. To date, structural motifs that are important for HDAC inhibitory activity and selectivity are described as: surface recognition group (CAP group), aliphatic or aromatic linker, and zinc-binding group (ZBG). The main idea of this FBDD method is to identify novel and target-selective CAP groups by virtual scanning of publicly available fragment databases. Template structure used to search for novel heterocyclic and carbocyclic fragments is 1,8-naphthalimide (CAP group of scriptaid, a potent HDAC inhibitor). Herein, the design of HDAC6 inhibitors is based on linking the identified fragments with the aliphatic or aromatic linker and hydroxamic acid (ZBG) moiety. Final selection of potential selective HDAC6 inhibitors is based on combined structure-based (molecular docking) and ligand-based (three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships, 3D-QSAR) techniques. Designed compounds are docked in the active site pockets of human HDAC1 and HDAC6 isoforms, and their docking conformations used to predict their HDAC inhibitory and selectivity profiles through two developed 3D-QSAR models (describing HDAC1 and HDAC6 inhibitory activities).","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2021

To enable more accurate ranking of active over inactive ligands in virtual screening, we created a machine learning consensus docking tool, MILCDock, that uses predictions from five traditional molecular docking tools to predict the probability a ligand binds to a protein. MILCDock was trained and tested on data from both the DUD-E and LIT-PCBA docking datasets and shows improved performance over traditional molecular docking tools and other consensus docking methods on the DUD-E dataset. LIT-PCBA targets proved to be difficult for all methods tested. We also find that DUD-E data, although biased, can be effective in training machine learning tools if care is taken to avoid DUD-E's biases during training.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022

26414598,Understanding the challenges of protein flexibility in drug design.,"INTRODUCTION: Protein-ligand interactions play key roles in various metabolic pathways, and the proteins involved in these interactions represent major targets for drug discovery. Molecular docking is widely used to predict the structure of protein-ligand complexes, and protein flexibility stands out as one of the most important and challenging issues for binding mode prediction. Various docking methods accounting for protein flexibility have been proposed, tackling problems of ever-increasing dimensionality. AREAS COVERED: This paper presents an overview of conformational sampling methods treating target flexibility during molecular docking. Special attention is given to approaches considering full protein flexibility. Contrary to what is frequently done, this review does not rely on classical biomolecular recognition models to classify existing docking methods. Instead, it applies algorithmic considerations, focusing on the level of flexibility accounted for. This review also discusses the diversity of docking applications, from virtual screening (VS) of small drug-like compounds to geometry prediction (GP) of protein-peptide complexes. EXPERT OPINION: Considering the diversity of docking methods presented here, deciding which one is the best at treating protein flexibility depends on the system under study and the research application. In VS experiments, ensemble docking can be used to implicitly account for large-scale conformational changes, and selective docking can additionally consider local binding-site rearrangements. In other cases, on-the-fly exploration of the whole protein-ligand complex might be needed for accurate GP of the binding mode. Among other things, future methods are expected to provide alternative binding modes, which will better reflect the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2015

To facilitate the drug repurposing computation, we constructed an automated and parameter-free virtual screening server, namely DrugRep, which performed molecular 3D structure construction, binding pocket prediction, docking, similarity comparison and binding affinity screening in a fully automatic manner. DrugRep repurposed drugs not only by receptor-based screening but also by ligand-based screening. The former automatically detected possible binding pockets of the receptor with our cavity detection approach, and then performed batch docking over drugs with a widespread docking program, AutoDock Vina. The latter explored drugs using seven well-established similarity measuring tools, including our recently developed ligand-similarity-based methods LigMate and FitDock. DrugRep utilized easy-to-use graphic interfaces for the user operation, and offered interactive predictions with state-of-the-art accuracy. We expect that this freely available online drug repurposing tool could be beneficial to the drug discovery community.

Adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine and uridine analogs such as didanosine, vidarabine, remdesivir, gemcitabine, lamivudine, acyclovir, abacavir, zidovusine, stavudine, and idoxuridine showed remarkable anticancer and antiviral activities. In our previously published articles, our main intention was to develop newer generation nucleoside analogs with acylation-induced modification of the hydroxyl group and showcase their biological potencies. In the process of developing nucleoside analogs, in silico studies play an important role and provide a scientific background for biological data. Molecular interactions between drugs and receptors followed by assessment of their stability in physiological environments, help to optimize the drug development process and minimize the burden of unwanted synthesis. Computational approaches, such as DFT, FMO, MEP, ADMET prediction, PASS prediction, POM analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation, are the most popular tools to culminate all preclinical study data and deliver a molecule with maximum bioactivity and minimum toxicity. Although clinical drug trials are crucial for providing dosage recommendations, they can only indirectly provide mechanistic information through researchers for pathological, physiological, and pharmacological determinants. As a result, in silico approaches are increasingly used in drug discovery and development to provide mechanistic information of clinical value.

38221904,Predicting drug-target binding affinity with cross-scale graph contrastive learning.,"Identifying the binding affinity between a drug and its target is essential in drug discovery and repurposing. Numerous computational approaches have been proposed for understanding these interactions. However, most existing methods only utilize either the molecular structure information of drugs and targets or the interaction information of drug-target bipartite networks. They may fail to combine the molecule-scale and network-scale features to obtain high-quality representations. In this study, we propose CSCo-DTA, a novel cross-scale graph contrastive learning approach for drug-target binding affinity prediction. The proposed model combines features learned from the molecular scale and the network scale to capture information from both local and global perspectives. We conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, and the proposed model outperformed existing state-of-art methods. The ablation experiment demonstrated the significance and efficacy of multi-scale features and cross-scale contrastive learning modules in improving the prediction performance. Moreover, we applied the CSCo-DTA to predict the novel potential targets for Erlotinib and validated the predicted targets with the molecular docking analysis.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2023

37680152,Comprehensive Review on Drug-target Interaction Prediction - Latest Developments and Overview.,"Drug-target interactions (DTIs) are an important part of the drug development process. When the drug (a chemical molecule) binds to a target (proteins or nucleic acids), it modulates the biological behavior/function of the target, returning it to its normal state. Predicting DTIs plays a vital role in the drug discovery (DD) process as it has the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. However, DTI prediction poses significant challenges and expenses due to the time-consuming and costly nature of experimental assays. As a result, researchers have increased their efforts to identify the association between medications and targets in the hopes of speeding up drug development and shortening the time to market. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the initial stage in drug discovery, namely drug-target interactions. It focuses on exploring the application of machine learning methods within this step. Additionally, we aim to conduct a comprehensive review of relevant papers and databases utilized in this field. Drug target interaction prediction covers a wide range of applications: drug discovery, prediction of adverse effects and drug repositioning.

The initial literature study revealed that many flavonoids, including luteolin, quercetin, kaempferol, and baicalin may be useful against SARS beta-coronaviruses, prompting the selection of their potential derivatives to investigate their abilities as inhibitors of COVID-19. The findings were streamlined using in silico molecular docking, which revealed promising energy-binding interactions between all flavonoid derivatives and the targeted protein. Notably, compounds 8, 9, 13, and 15 demonstrated higher potency against the coronavirus Mpro protein (PDB ID 6M2N). Compound 8 has a -7.2 Kcal/mol affinity for the protein and binds to it by hydrogen bonding with Gln192 and pi-sulfur bonding with Met-165. Compound 9 exhibited a significant interaction with the main protease, demonstrating an affinity of -7.9 kcal/mol. Gln-192, Glu-189, Pro-168, and His-41 were the principle amino acid residues involved in this interaction. The docking score for compound 13 is -7.5 Kcal/mol, and it binds to the protease enzyme by making interactions with Leu-41, pi-sigma, and Gln-189. These interactions include hydrogen bonding and pi-sulfur. The major protease and compound 15 were found to bind with a favourable affinity of -6.8 Kcal/mol. This finding was further validated through molecular dynamic simulation for 1ns, analysing parameters such as RMSD, RMSF, and RoG profiles. The RoG values for all four of the compounds varied significantly (35.2-36.4). The results demonstrated the stability of the selected compounds during the simulation. After passing the stability testing, the compounds underwent screening for ADME and drug-likeness properties, fulfilling all the necessary criteria.

33920024,Ligand-Receptor Interactions and Machine Learning in GCGR and GLP-1R Drug Discovery.,"The large amount of data that has been collected so far for G protein-coupled receptors requires machine learning (ML) approaches to fully exploit its potential. Our previous ML model based on gradient boosting used for prediction of drug affinity and selectivity for a receptor subtype was compared with explicit information on ligand-receptor interactions from induced-fit docking. Both methods have proved their usefulness in drug response predictions. Yet, their successful combination still requires allosteric/orthosteric assignment of ligands from datasets. Our ligand datasets included activities of two members of the secretin receptor family: GCGR and GLP-1R. Simultaneous activation of two or three receptors of this family by dual or triple agonists is not a typical kind of information included in compound databases. A precise allosteric/orthosteric ligand assignment requires a continuous update based on new structural and biological data. This data incompleteness remains the main obstacle for current ML methods applied to class B GPCR drug discovery. Even so, for these two class B receptors, our ligand-based ML model demonstrated high accuracy (5-fold cross-validation Q(2) > 0.63 and Q(2) > 0.67 for GLP-1R and GCGR, respectively). In addition, we performed a ligand annotation using recent cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallographic data on small-molecule complexes of GCGR and GLP-1R. As a result, we assigned GLP-1R and GCGR actives deposited in ChEMBL to four small-molecule binding sites occupied by positive and negative allosteric modulators and a full agonist. Annotated compounds were added to our recently released repository of GPCR data.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021

Different molecular docking techniques most widely used in silico methods in drug discovery. Currently, the time and financial costs for the initial hit identification can be significantly reduced due to the ability to perform high-throughput virtual screening of large compound libraries in a short time. However, the selection of potential hit compounds still remains more of a random process, because there is still no consensus on what the binding energy and ligand efficiency (LE) of a potentially active compound should be. In the best cases, only 20-30% of compounds identified by molecular docking are active in biological tests. In this work, we evaluated the impact of the docking software used as well as the type of the target protein on the molecular docking results and their accuracy using an example of the three most popular programs and five target proteins related to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we attempted to determine the ""reliable range"" of the binding energy and LE that would allow selecting compounds with biological activity in the desired concentration range.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022

30360719,Recent Advances in the System Biology-based Target Identification and Drug Discovery.,"The enormous quantity of publicly available active chemical ligand and biological receptor data knowledge allows scientists to retreat several open questions by the analysis and systematic integration of these complex unique data. Systems biology plays a crucial role through the constructive alignment of bio-physiochemical monitoring of gene, protein along with metabolites from the complex data. Further, it integrates information within the data and responses (metabolic and signaling pathway) which lead to the formulation of computational models for the elucidation of structure and function of the molecular determinant.

32901584,Efficiency of Homology Modeling Assisted Molecular Docking in G-protein Coupled Receptors.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular docking is in regular practice to assess ligand affinity on a target protein crystal structure. In the absence of protein crystal structure, the homology modeling or comparative modeling is the best alternative to elucidate the relationship details between a ligand and protein at the molecular level. The development of accurate homology modeling (HM) and its integration with molecular docking (MD) is essential for successful, rational drug discovery. OBJECTIVE: The G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are attractive therapeutic targets due to their immense role in human pharmacology. The GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins with the complex constitution, and the understanding of their activation and inactivation mechanisms is quite challenging. Over the past decade, there has been a rapid expansion in the number of solved G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crystal structures; however, the majority of the GPCR structures remain unsolved. In this context, HM guided MD has been widely used for structure-based drug design (SBDD) of GPCRs. METHODS: The focus of this review is on the recent (i) developments on HM supported GPCR drug discovery in the absence of GPCR crystal structures and (ii) application of HM in understanding the ligand interactions at the binding site, virtual screening, determining receptor subtype selectivity and receptor behaviour in comparison with GPCR crystal structures. RESULTS: The HM in GPCRs has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity in template structures. In such a scenario, it is difficult to get accurate HM that can facilitate understanding of the ligand-receptor interactions. This problem has been alleviated to some extent by developing refined HM based on incorporating active /inactive ligand information and inducing protein flexibility. In some cases, HM proteins were found to outscore crystal structures. CONCLUSION: The developments in HM have been highly operative to gain insights about the ligand interaction at the binding site and receptor functioning at the molecular level. Thus, HM guided molecular docking may be useful for rational drug discovery for the GPCRs mediated diseases.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2021

On SciFinder(R), we evaluated more than 600 publications through systematic searching and refining, using the terms, virtual screening; software methods; computational studies and publication year, in order to obtain data concerning particular aspects of CADD. The primary focus of this review was on the databases screened, virtual screening and/or molecular docking software program used. Furthermore, we evaluated the studies that subsequently performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and we reviewed the software programs applied, the application of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental assays. To represent the latest trends, the most recent data obtained was between 2015 and 2020, consequently the most frequently employed techniques and software programs were recorded. Among these, the ZINC database was the most widely preferred with an average use of 31.2%. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was the most prominently used type of virtual screening and it accounted for an average of 57.6%, with AutoDock being the preferred virtual screening/molecular docking program with 41.8% usage. Following the screening process, 38.5% of the studies performed MD simulations to complement the virtual screening and GROMACS with 39.3% usage, was the popular MD software program. Among the computational techniques, DFT was the least applied whereby it only accounts for 0.02% average use.

29412997,Structural Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions by Docking: Application to Biomedical Problems.,"A huge amount of genetic information is available thanks to the recent advances in sequencing technologies and the larger computational capabilities, but the interpretation of such genetic data at phenotypic level remains elusive. One of the reasons is that proteins are not acting alone, but are specifically interacting with other proteins and biomolecules, forming intricate interaction networks that are essential for the majority of cell processes and pathological conditions. Thus, characterizing such interaction networks is an important step in understanding how information flows from gene to phenotype. Indeed, structural characterization of protein-protein interactions at atomic resolution has many applications in biomedicine, from diagnosis and vaccine design, to drug discovery. However, despite the advances of experimental structural determination, the number of interactions for which there is available structural data is still very small. In this context, a complementary approach is computational modeling of protein interactions by docking, which is usually composed of two major phases: (i) sampling of the possible binding modes between the interacting molecules and (ii) scoring for the identification of the correct orientations. In addition, prediction of interface and hot-spot residues is very useful in order to guide and interpret mutagenesis experiments, as well as to understand functional and mechanistic aspects of the interaction. Computational docking is already being applied to specific biomedical problems within the context of personalized medicine, for instance, helping to interpret pathological mutations involved in protein-protein interactions, or providing modeled structural data for drug discovery targeting protein-protein interactions.",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2018
39377567,Strategic lead compound design and development utilizing computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) to address herbicide-resistant Phalaris minor in wheat fields.,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a vital cereal crop and a staple food source worldwide. However, wheat grain productivity has significantly declined as a consequence of infestations by Phalaris minor. Traditional weed control methods have proven inadequate owing to the physiological similarities between P. minor and wheat during early growth stages. Consequently, farmers have turned to herbicides, targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), acetolactate synthase (ALS) and photosystem II (PSII). Isoproturon targeting PSII was introduced in mid-1970s, to manage P. minor infestations. Despite their effectiveness, the repetitive use of these herbicides has led to the development of herbicide-resistant P. minor biotypes, posing a significant challenge to wheat productivity. To address this issue, there is a pressing need for innovative weed management strategies and the discovery of novel herbicide molecules. The integration of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) techniques has emerged as a promising approach in herbicide research, that facilitates the identification of herbicide targets and enables the screening of large chemical libraries for potential herbicide-like molecules. By employing techniques such as homology modelling, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and pharmacophore modelling, CADD has become a rapid and cost-effective medium to accelerate the herbicide discovery process significantly. This approach not only reduces the dependency on traditional experimental methods, but also enhances the precision and efficacy of herbicide development.

Docking calculations are one of the commonly used and highly appreciated structure-based drug discovery methods. Databases for chemical structures of small molecules have been growing rapidly. However, at the moment virtual screening of large libraries via docking is not very common. In this work, we aim to accelerate docking studies by predicting docking scores without explicitly performing docking calculations. We experimented with an attention based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for an efficient prediction of docking scores as well as other machine learning models such as XGBoost. By using docking scores of a small number of ligands we trained our models and predicted docking scores of a few million molecules. Specifically, we tested our approaches on 11 datasets that were produced from in-house drug discovery studies. On average, by training models using only 7000 molecules we predicted docking scores of approximately 3.8 million molecules with R(2) (coefficient of determination) of 0.77 and Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.85.

Here, we performed a fragment-based drug discovery of TbGPI-PLC inhibitors using a combination of enzymatic inhibition assay and water ligand observed via gradient spectroscopy (WaterLOGSY) NMR experiment. The TbGPI-PLC was cloned and overexpressed using an Escherichia coli expression system followed by purification using three-phase partitioning and gel filtration. Subsequently, the inhibitory activity of 873 fragment compounds against the recombinant TbGPI-PLC led to the identification of 66 primary hits. These primary hits were subjected to the WaterLOGSY NMR experiment where 10 fragment hits were confirmed to directly bind to the TbGPI-PLC. These included benzothiazole, chlorobenzene, imidazole, indole, pyrazol and quinolinone derivatives. Molecular docking simulation indicated that six of them share a common binding site, which corresponds to the catalytic pocket.

Sometimes more than one approach is implemented to mine out the potential drug target and characterize the on-target or off-target effects. A novel anticancer agent RH1 is designed as pro-drug to be activated by NQO1, an enzyme overexpressed in many types of tumors. However, increasing data show that RH1 can affect cells in NQO1-independent fashion.

We have examined 129 protein kinases in total where 96 protein kinases are in complexes with their inhibitor, 11 kinases were in the unbound state with any ligand and for 22 protein kinases 3D structure were modeled. Comparison of calculated free energy of binding of RH1 with indigenous kinase inhibitors binding efficiency as well as alignment of their pharmacophoric maps let us predict and ranked protein kinases such as KIT, CDK2, CDK6, MAPK1, NEK2 and others as the most prominent off-targets of RH1.

The crucial role of TP in cancer development makes it an important target for anticancer drug discovery. Currently, there is only one US-FDA-approved drug, i.e., Lonsurf, a combination of trifluridine and tipiracil, for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, numerous adverse effects are associated with its use, such as myelosuppression, anemia, and neutropenia. Since the last few decades, the discovery of new, safe, and effective TP inhibitory agents has been rigorously pursued. In the present study, we evaluated a series of previously synthesized dihydropyrimidone derivatives 1-40 for their TP inhibitory potential. Compounds 1, 12, and 33 showed a good activity with IC(50) = 314.0 +/- 0.90, 303.5 +/- 0.40, and 322.6 +/- 1.60 microM, respectively. The results of mechanistic studies revealed that compounds 1, 12, and 33 were the non-competitive inhibitors. These compounds were also evaluated for cytotoxicity against 3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells and were found to be non-cytotoxic.

OBJECTIVE: To find highly specific small molecules towards very similar protein targets, multiple strategies are always employed, including (1) To make use of the diverse shape of binding pocket to avoid steric bump; (2) To increase binding affinities for favorite residues; (3) To achieve selectivity through allosteric regulation of target; (4) To stabalize the inactive conformation of protein target and (5) To occupy dual binding pockets of single target. CONCLUSION: In this review, we summarize computational strategies along with examples of their successful applications in designing selective ligands, with the aim to provide insights into everdiversifying drug development practice and inspire medicinal chemists to utilize computational strategies to avoid potential side effects due to low selectivity of ligands.",Current drug targets,2020
38019732,Drug repositioning based on weighted local information augmented graph neural network.,"Drug repositioning, the strategy of redirecting existing drugs to new therapeutic purposes, is pivotal in accelerating drug discovery. While many studies have engaged in modeling complex drug-disease associations, they often overlook the relevance between different node embeddings. Consequently, we propose a novel weighted local information augmented graph neural network model, termed DRAGNN, for drug repositioning. Specifically, DRAGNN firstly incorporates a graph attention mechanism to dynamically allocate attention coefficients to drug and disease heterogeneous nodes, enhancing the effectiveness of target node information collection. To prevent excessive embedding of information in a limited vector space, we omit self-node information aggregation, thereby emphasizing valuable heterogeneous and homogeneous information. Additionally, average pooling in neighbor information aggregation is introduced to enhance local information while maintaining simplicity. A multi-layer perceptron is then employed to generate the final association predictions. The model's effectiveness for drug repositioning is supported by a 10-times 10-fold cross-validation on three benchmark datasets. Further validation is provided through analysis of the predicted associations using multiple authoritative data sources, molecular docking experiments and drug-disease network analysis, laying a solid foundation for future drug discovery.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2023

The new method provides great flexibility in drug design and drug candidates with considerably lower risk in an efficient manner. As a model system, 45 sulphonamides (33 training, 12 testing ligands) in complex with carbonic anhydrase IX were used for development of quantitative structure-activity-lipophilicity (property)-relationships (QSPRs). For each ligand, nearly 5,000 molecular descriptors were calculated, while lipophilicity (logk(w)) and inhibitory activity (logK(i)) were used as drug properties. Genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) provided a QSPR model with high prediction capability employing only seven molecular descriptors. As a proof-of-concept, optimal drug structure was obtained by inverting the model with respect to reference drug properties. 3509 ligands were ranked accordingly. Top 10 ligands were further validated through molecular docking. Large-scale MD simulations were performed to test the stability of structures of selected ligands obtained through docking complemented with biophysical experiments.",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2018

32016898,Binding Free Energy Calculation Using Quantum Mechanics Aimed for Drug Lead Optimization.,"The routine use of in silico tools is already established in drug lead design. Besides the use of molecular docking methods to screen large chemical libraries and thus prioritize compounds for purchase or synthesis, more accurate calculations of protein-ligand binding free energy has shown the potential to guide lead optimization, thus saving time and resources. Theoretical developments and advances in computing power have allowed quantum mechanical-based methods applied to calculations on biomacromolecules to be increasingly explored and used, with the purpose of providing a more accurate description of protein-ligand interactions and an enhanced level of accuracy in the calculation of binding affinities. It should be noted that the quantum mechanical formulation includes, in principle, all contributions to the energy, considering terms usually neglected in molecular mechanics force fields, such as electronic polarization, metal coordination, and covalent binding; moreover, quantum mechanical approaches are systematically improvable. By treating all elements and interactions on equal footing, and avoiding the need of system-dependent parameterizations, they provide a greater degree of transferability. In this review, we illustrate the increasing relevance of quantum mechanical methods for binding free energy calculation in the context of structure-based drug lead optimization, showing representative applications of the different approaches available.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2020

AREAS COVERED: The authors review the structural information that has emerged for ligand-mediated 7TM proteins, including the class A, B, C, and F receptors, focusing on the 7TM domains for the multi-domain proteins. The authors describe the key regions associated with ligand binding as well as features responsible for function such as activation versus inhibition and biased signaling. Furthermore, the authors summarize the effectiveness of computational studies to help clarify the structure-function information and their use for drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: There is now a significant amount of structural information covering a range of 7TM protein classes (A, B, C, and F) and activation states. For these and closely related proteins, structure-based drug discovery has proven to be a powerful tool. More structural information is needed with respect to dimerization, 7TM proteins with beta-arrestin to help in understanding the control of biased signaling, and full-protein structure determinations for non-class A proteins to help in understanding and controlling their functioning.

35121854,Artificial intelligence-enabled virtual screening of ultra-large chemical libraries with deep docking.,"With the recent explosion of chemical libraries beyond a billion molecules, more efficient virtual screening approaches are needed. The Deep Docking (DD) platform enables up to 100-fold acceleration of structure-based virtual screening by docking only a subset of a chemical library, iteratively synchronized with a ligand-based prediction of the remaining docking scores. This method results in hundreds- to thousands-fold virtual hit enrichment (without significant loss of potential drug candidates) and hence enables the screening of billion molecule-sized chemical libraries without using extraordinary computational resources. Herein, we present and discuss the generalized DD protocol that has been proven successful in various computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) campaigns and can be applied in conjunction with any conventional docking program. The protocol encompasses eight consecutive stages: molecular library preparation, receptor preparation, random sampling of a library, ligand preparation, molecular docking, model training, model inference and the residual docking. The standard DD workflow enables iterative application of stages 3-7 with continuous augmentation of the training set, and the number of such iterations can be adjusted by the user. A predefined recall value allows for control of the percentage of top-scoring molecules that are retained by DD and can be adjusted to control the library size reduction. The procedure takes 1-2 weeks (depending on the available resources) and can be completely automated on computing clusters managed by job schedulers. This open-source protocol, at https://github.com/jamesgleave/DD_protocol , can be readily deployed by CADD researchers and can significantly accelerate the effective exploration of ultra-large portions of a chemical space.",Nature protocols,2022

38019636,InVADo: Interactive Visual Analysis of Molecular Docking Data.,"Molecular docking is a key technique in various fields like structural biology, medicinal chemistry, and biotechnology. It is widely used for virtual screening during drug discovery, computer-assisted drug design, and protein engineering. A general molecular docking process consists of the target and ligand selection, their preparation, and the docking process itself, followed by the evaluation of the results. However, the most commonly used docking software provides no or very basic evaluation possibilities. Scripting and external molecular viewers are often used, which are not designed for an efficient analysis of docking results.

Hardware acceleration of Vina on FPGA platforms offers a high energy-efficiency approach to speed up the docking process. However, previous FPGA-based Vina accelerators exhibit several shortcomings: 1) Simple uniform quantization results in inevitable accuracy drop; 2) Due to Vina's complex computing process, the evaluation and optimization phase for hardware design becomes extended; 3) The iterative computations in Vina constrain the potential for further parallelization. 4) The system's scalability is limited by its unwieldy architecture. To address the above challenges, we propose Vina-FPGA-cluster, a multi-FPGA-based molecular docking tool enabling high-accuracy and multi-level parallel Vina acceleration. Standing upon the shoulders of Vina-FPGA, we first adapt hybrid fixed-point quantization to minimize accuracy loss. We then propose a SystemC-based model, accelerating the hardware accelerator architecture design evaluation. Next, we propose a novel bidirectional AG module for data-level parallelism. Finally, we optimize the system architecture for scalable deployment on multiple Xilinx ZCU104 boards, achieving task-level parallelism. Vina-FPGA-cluster is tested on three representative molecular docking datasets. The experiment results indicate that in the context of RMSD (for successful docking outcomes with metrics below 2A), Vina-FPGA-cluster shows a mere 0.2% lose. Relative to CPU and Vina-FPGA, Vina-FPGA-cluster achieves 27.33 and 7.26 speedup, respectively.

36943644,Efficient screening of protein-ligand complexes in lipid bilayers using LoCoMock score.,"Membrane proteins are attractive targets for drug discovery due to their crucial roles in various biological processes. Studying the binding poses of amphipathic molecules to membrane proteins is essential for understanding the functions of membrane proteins and docking simulations can facilitate the screening of protein-ligand complexes at low computational costs. However, identifying docking poses for a ligand in non-aqueous environments such as lipid bilayers can be challenging. To address this issue, we propose a new docking score called logP-corrected membrane docking (LoCoMock) score. To screen putative protein-ligand complexes embedded in a membrane, the LoCoMock score considers the affinity between a target ligand and the membrane. It combines the docking score of the protein-ligand complex with the logP of the target ligand. In demonstrations using several model ligands, the LoCoMock score screened more putative complexes than the conventional docking score. As extended docking, the LoCoMock score makes it possible to screen membrane proteins more effectively as drug targets than the conventional docking.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2023

29243483,Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations in Drug Discovery: Recent Advances and Practical Considerations.,"Accurate in silico prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2017

39729480,"Discovery of novel TACE inhibitors using graph convolutional network, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and Biological evaluation.","The increasing utilization of deep learning models in drug repositioning has proven to be highly efficient and effective. In this study, we employed an integrated deep-learning model followed by traditional drug screening approach to screen a library of FDA-approved drugs, aiming to identify novel inhibitors targeting the TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). TACE, also known as ADAM17, plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response by converting pro-TNF-alpha to its active soluble form and cleaving other inflammatory mediators, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Reference datasets containing active and decoy compounds specific to TACE were obtained from the DUD-E database. Using RDKit, a cheminformatics toolkit, we extracted molecular features from these compounds. We applied the GraphConvMol model within the DeepChem framework, which utilizes graph convolutional networks, to build a predictive model based on the DUD-E datasets. Our trained model was subsequently used to predict the TACE inhibitory potential of FDA-approved drugs. From these predictions, Vorinostat was identified as a potential TACE inhibitor. Moreover, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were conducted to validate these findings, using BMS-561392 as a reference TACE inhibitor. Vorinostat, originally an FDA-approved drug for cancer treatment, exhibited strong binding interactions with key TACE residues, suggesting its repurposing potential. Biological evaluation with RAW 264.7 cell confirmed the computational results, demonstrating that Vorinostat exhibited comparable inhibitory activity against TACE. In conclusion, our study highlights the capability of deep learning models to enhance virtual screening efforts in drug discovery, efficiently identifying potential candidates for specific targets such as TACE.

38131311,How accurately can one predict drug binding modes using AlphaFold models?,"Computational prediction of protein structure has been pursued intensely for decades, motivated largely by the goal of using structural models for drug discovery. Recently developed machine-learning methods such as AlphaFold 2 (AF2) have dramatically improved protein structure prediction, with reported accuracy approaching that of experimentally determined structures. To what extent do these advances translate to an ability to predict more accurately how drugs and drug candidates bind to their target proteins? Here, we carefully examine the utility of AF2 protein structure models for predicting binding poses of drug-like molecules at the largest class of drug targets, the G-protein-coupled receptors. We find that AF2 models capture binding pocket structures much more accurately than traditional homology models, with errors nearly as small as differences between structures of the same protein determined experimentally with different ligands bound. Strikingly, however, the accuracy of ligand-binding poses predicted by computational docking to AF2 models is not significantly higher than when docking to traditional homology models and is much lower than when docking to structures determined experimentally without these ligands bound. These results have important implications for all those who might use predicted protein structures for drug discovery.",eLife,2023

Although multiple highly accurate deep learning- or machine learning-based scoring functions have been developed, their direct applications for docking and screening are limited. We describe a novel strategy to develop a reliable protein-ligand scoring function by augmenting the traditional scoring function Vina score using a correction term (OnionNet-SFCT). The correction term is developed based on an AdaBoost random forest model, utilizing multiple layers of contacts formed between protein residues and ligand atoms. In addition to the Vina score, the model considerably enhances the AutoDock Vina prediction abilities for docking and screening tasks based on different benchmarks (such as cross-docking dataset, CASF-2016, DUD-E and DUD-AD). Furthermore, our model could be combined with multiple docking applications to increase pose selection accuracies and screening abilities, indicating its wide usage for structure-based drug discoveries. Furthermore, in a reverse practice, the combined scoring strategy successfully identified multiple known receptors of a plant hormone. To summarize, the results show that the combination of data-driven model (OnionNet-SFCT) and empirical scoring function (Vina score) is a good scoring strategy that could be useful for structure-based drug discoveries and potentially target fishing in future.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2022
38940179,Enhancing generalizability and performance in drug-target interaction identification by integrating pharmacophore and pre-trained models.,"MOTIVATION: In drug discovery, it is crucial to assess the drug-target binding affinity (DTA). Although molecular docking is widely used, computational efficiency limits its application in large-scale virtual screening. Deep learning-based methods learn virtual scoring functions from labeled datasets and can quickly predict affinity. However, there are three limitations. First, existing methods only consider the atom-bond graph or one-dimensional sequence representations of compounds, ignoring the information about functional groups (pharmacophores) with specific biological activities. Second, relying on limited labeled datasets fails to learn comprehensive embedding representations of compounds and proteins, resulting in poor generalization performance in complex scenarios. Third, existing feature fusion methods cannot adequately capture contextual interaction information. RESULTS: Therefore, we propose a novel DTA prediction method named HeteroDTA. Specifically, a multi-view compound feature extraction module is constructed to model the atom-bond graph and pharmacophore graph. The residue concat graph and protein sequence are also utilized to model protein structure and function. Moreover, to enhance the generalization capability and reduce the dependence on task-specific labeled data, pre-trained models are utilized to initialize the atomic features of the compounds and the embedding representations of the protein sequence. A context-aware nonlinear feature fusion method is also proposed to learn interaction patterns between compounds and proteins. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that HeteroDTA significantly outperforms existing methods. In addition, HeteroDTA shows excellent generalization performance in cold-start experiments and superiority in the representation learning ability of drug-target pairs. Finally, the effectiveness of HeteroDTA is demonstrated in a real-world drug discovery study.

Methods such as virtual screening, which can filter out ineffective compounds from drug libraries prior to expensive experimental study, have become popular research topics. As the computational drug discovery community has grown, in order to benchmark the various advances in methodology, organizations such as the Drug Design Data Resource have begun hosting blinded grand challenges seeking to identify the best methods for ligand pose-prediction, ligand affinity ranking, and free energy calculations.

26477294,A computational chemistry perspective on the current status and future direction of hepatitis B antiviral drug discovery.,"Computational chemical biology, applied to research on hepatitis B virus (HBV), has two major branches: bioinformatics (statistical models) and first-principle methods (molecular physics). While bioinformatics focuses on statistical tools and biological databases, molecular physics uses mathematics and chemical theory to study the interactions of biomolecules. Three computational techniques most commonly used in HBV research are homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics. Homology modeling is a computational simulation to predict protein structure and has been used to construct conformers of the viral polymerase (reverse transcriptase domain and RNase H domain) and the HBV X protein. Molecular docking is used to predict the most likely orientation of a ligand when it is bound to a protein, as well as determining an energy score of the docked conformation. Molecular dynamics is a simulation that analyzes biomolecule motions and determines conformation and stability patterns. All of these modeling techniques have aided in the understanding of resistance mutations on HBV non-nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor binding. Finally, bioinformatics can be used to study the DNA and RNA protein sequences of viruses to both analyze drug resistance and to genotype the viral genomes. Overall, with these techniques, and others, computational chemical biology is becoming more and more necessary in hepatitis B research.

36450217,Knowledge-driven design and optimization of potent symmetric anticancer molecules: A case study on PKM2 activators.,"BACKGROUND: Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is preferentially expressed as a low-activity dimer over the active tetramer in proliferating tumor cells, resulting in metabolic reprogramming to achieve high energy requirements and nutrient uptake. This leads to a shift from the normal glycolytic pathway causing tumor cells to proliferate uncontrollably. This study utilizes knowledge-based drug discovery to determine the critical features from experimentally known PKM2 activators and design compounds that would significantly confer a stable structural and functional edge over the known compounds which are still at the preclinical stage. METHODS: Conscientious molecular modeling studies were carried out and critical structural features were identified and validated from the knowledge of experimentally known PKM2 activators to confer high-binding affinities. A virtual library of 200 palindromic and non-palindromic activators was designed based on these identified critical features to target a distinct activator binding-site. This binding would favor specific dimer-dimer association and subsequent protein tetramerization. The resultant compounds strongly correlated with identified structural features and binding affinities which further strengthened our findings. The designed activators were then subjected to pharmacokinetic profiling and toxicity prediction, followed by free-binding energy calculations and MD simulations. RESULTS: All the virtually designed activators comprising the identified critical features were observed to confer high-binding affinities ranging from -9.1 to -15.0 kcal/mol to the receptor protein. The designed activators also demonstrated optimum pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. CONCLUSION: The best activators selected for MD simulations studies were conclusively observed to stabilize the required tetrameric conformation suggesting that these activators could potentially target PKM2 tetramerization that might restore the normal glycolytic pathway and suppress tumor progression.",Computers in biology and medicine,2022

Phosphotransferase system of S. mutans, specifically enzyme II mannose transporter (EII(Man)) in its subunits IIA, IIB and IIC by means of a selection protocol and in silico molecular analysis. Intervening the phosphotransferase system would compromise the physiological behavior and the pathogenic expression of S. mutans, and possibly other acidogenic bacteria that use phosphotransferases in their metabolism-making the phosphotransferase system a therapeutic target for the selective control of acidogenic microorganisms in caries control. Several computational techniques were used to evaluate molecular, physicochemical, and toxicological aspects of various compounds.

32722024,Drug Discovery Targeting the Disorder-To-Order Transition Regions through the Conformational Diversity Mimicking and Statistical Analysis.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins exist as highly dynamic conformational ensembles of diverse forms. However, the majority of virtual screening only focuses on proteins with defined structures. This means that computer-aided drug discovery is restricted. As a breakthrough, understanding the structural characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins and its application can open the gate for unrestricted drug discovery. First, we segmented the target disorder-to-order transition region into a series of overlapping 20-amino-acid-long peptides. Folding prediction generated diverse conformations of these peptides. Next, we applied molecular docking, new evaluation score function, and statistical analysis. This approach successfully distinguished known compounds and their corresponding binding regions. Especially, Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC) inhibitor 10058F4 was well distinguished from others of the chemical compound library. We also studied differences between the two Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) inhibitors (ABA (2-amino-N-[[(3S)-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-3-yl]methyl]-acetamide) and APC ((R)-(3-(2-Amino-acetylamino)-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester))). Both compounds bind MBD2 through electrostatic interaction behind its p66alpha-binding site. ABA is also able to bind p66alpha through electrostatic interaction behind its MBD2-binding site while APC-p66alpha binding was nonspecific. Therefore, structural heterogeneity mimicking of the disorder-to-order transition region at the peptide level and utilization of the new docking score function represent a useful approach that can efficiently discriminate compounds for expanded virtual screening toward intrinsically disordered proteins.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020

In the present study, cytotoxic activities of different Iranian Chrysanthemum morifolium cultivars were evaluated in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) and human lymphocytes. A systems pharmacology approach was employed between major compounds of these cultivars (chlorogenic acid, luteolin, quercetin, rutin, ferulic acid, and apigenin) and known breast cancer drugs (tucatinib, methotrexate, tamoxifen, and mitomycin) with 22 breast cancer-related targets to analyze the mechanism through which Chrysanthemum cultivars act on breast cancer. Target validation was performed by the molecular docking method. The results indicated that Chrysanthemum extracts inhibited the proliferation of MCF7 cells in a dose- and cultivar-dependent manner. In all studied cultivars, the most effective extract concentration with the lowest viability of MCF-7 cells, was as much as 312 microg ml(-1). Also, higher concentrations of the extracts (> 1000 microg ml(-1)) reduced the lymphocyte cell viability, demonstrating that these doses were toxic. The gene ontology analysis revealed the therapeutic effects of Chrysanthemum's active compounds on breast cancer by regulating the biological processes of their protein targets. Moreover, it has been documented that rutin, owing to its anticancer effects and several other health benefits, is a promising multi-targeted herbal ingredient.

The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) plays an important role in differentiation process. We aim to find a therapeutic target in redifferentiation strategies for thyroid cancer. METHODS: Our study integrated the differentially expressed genes acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus database by comparing TSHR expression levels in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. We conducted functional enrichment analysis and verified the expression of these genes by RT-PCR in 68 pairs of thyroid tumor and paratumor tissues. Artificial intelligence-enabled virtual screening was combined with the VirtualFlow platform for deep docking. RESULTS: We identified five genes (KCNJ16, SLC26A4, TG, TPO, and SYT1) as potential cancer treatment targets. TSHR and KCNJ16 were downregulated in the thyroid tumor tissues, compared with paired normal tissues. In addition, KCNJ16 was lower in the vascular/capsular invasion group. Enrichment analyses revealed that KCNJ16 may play a significant role in cell growth and differentiation. The inward rectifier potassium channel 5.1 (Kir5.1, encoded by KCNJ16) emerged as an interesting target in thyroid cancer.

39448664,Improving docking and virtual screening performance using AlphaFold2 multi-state modeling for kinases.,"Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a crucial computational approach in drug discovery, but its performance is sensitive to structural variations. Kinases, which are major drug targets, exemplify this challenge due to active site conformational changes caused by different inhibitor types. Most experimentally determined kinase structures have the DFGin state, potentially biasing SBVS towards type I inhibitors and limiting the discovery of diverse scaffolds. We introduce a multi-state modeling (MSM) protocol for AlphaFold2 (AF2) kinase structures using state-specific templates to address these challenges. Our comprehensive benchmarks evaluate predicted model qualities, binding pose prediction accuracy, and hit compound identification through ensemble SBVS. Results demonstrate that MSM models exhibit comparable or improved structural accuracy compared to standard AF2 models, enhancing pose prediction accuracy and effectively capturing kinase-ligand interactions. In virtual screening experiments, our MSM approach consistently outperforms standard AF2 and AF3 modeling, particularly in identifying diverse hit compounds. This study highlights the potential of MSM in broadening kinase inhibitor discovery by facilitating the identification of chemically diverse inhibitors, offering a promising solution to the structural bias problem in kinase-targeted drug discovery.",Scientific reports,2024

36179510,A comprehensive review on recent approaches for cancer drug discovery associated with artificial intelligence.,"Through the revolutionization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in clinical research, significant improvement is observed in diagnosis of cancer. Utilization of these AI technologies, such as machine and deep learning, is imperative for the discovery of novel anticancer drugs and improves existing/ongoing cancer therapeutics. However, building a model for complicated cancers and their types remains a challenge due to lack of effective therapeutics that hinder the establishment of effective computational tools. In this review, we exploit recent approaches and state-of-the-art in implementing AI methods for anticancer drug discovery, and discussed how advances in these applications need to be considered in the current cancer therapeutics. Considering the immense potential of AI, we explore molecular docking and their interactions to recognize metabolic activities that support drug design. Finally, we highlight corresponding strategies in applying machine and deep learning methods to various types of cancer with their pros and cons.",Computers in biology and medicine,2022
28843611,"Function and structure-based screening of compounds, peptides and proteins to identify drug candidates.","Drug discovery in simple words is all about finding small molecular compounds that possess the potential to interact with specific bio-macromolecules, mainly proteins, thereby bringing a desired effect in the functioning of the target molecules. Virtual screening of large compound libraries using computational approaches has come up as a great alternative to cost and labor-intensive high-throughput screening carried out in laboratories. Virtual high-throughput screening enormously reduces the number of compounds for systematic analysis using biochemical assays before entering the clinical trials. Here, we first give a brief overview of the rationale behind virtual screening, types of virtual screening - structure-based, ligand-based and inverse virtual screening, and challenges that need to be addressed to improve the existing strategies. Subsequently, we describe the methodology adopted for virtual screening of small molecules, peptides and proteins. Finally, we use few case studies to provide a better insight to the application of computer-aided high-throughput screening.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2017
39240197,Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE.,"Small-molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2-based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Induced Fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model-based small-molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different mammalian protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here, we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.",eLife,2024

In the present study, four potent small molecule inhibitors (A01, A02, A03 and A04) of AChE with new chemical scaffold were identified. Inhibitor A03 displayed the most potent inhibition activity on AChE at enzymatic level with IC(50) value of 180 nM, and high selectivity towards AChE over butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by more than 100-fold. The binding modes of compounds A01-A04 were carefully analyzed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to provide informative clues for further structure modification.

38100564,Structure-based molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations study for the identification of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes.,"Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Bioinformatics-driven approaches have emerged as crucial tools in drug discovery. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are effective tools in drug discovery, as they reduce the time and cost associated with experimental screening. In this study, we employed structure-assisted in-silico methods, including molecular docking and MD simulations, to identify SRT2183, a small molecule that may potentially inhibit the activity of DPP4 enzyme. The interaction between the small molecule ""SRT2183"" and DPP4 exhibited a binding affinity of -9.9 Kcal/Mol, leading to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues MET348, SER376, and THR351 of DPP4. The MD simulations over a period of 100 ns indicated stable protein-ligand interactions, with no significant conformational rearrangements observed within the simulated timeframe. In conclusion, our results suggest that the small molecule SRT2183 may have the potential to inhibit the DPP4 enzyme and pave the way for the therapeutics of T2DM.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, the currently approved CDK4/6 inhibitors are associated with various side effects, underscoring the need for novel compounds with enhanced efficacy and safety profiles. This study aimed to identify potential CDK4/6 inhibitors from MeFSAT, a database of fungal secondary metabolites using an in-silico screening approach. The virtual screening process incorporated drug-likeness filters, ADME and toxicity predictions, consensus molecular docking, and 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations. Out of 411 initial compounds, two molecules demonstrated favorable binding interactions and stability with the CDK4/6 protein complex. The MTT assay showed that MSID000025 had dose-dependent cytotoxicity against MCF7 breast cancer cells. This suggests that MSID000025 could be a good candidate CDK4/6 inhibitor for treating breast cancer.

The availability of software, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics data that are free and friendly to use increases the interest in carrying the software, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics out in drug discovery projects. The computational method is believed to speed up the discovery of new drugs, because the computational method can predict the molecular behavior of chemical compounds to interact with biological systems. Therefore, the real experimental study cost should be minimized, since there are a few promising molecules for a drug in silico only that would be investigated further. This article describes a decade of research concerning drug design and discovery aided by computers in Indonesia from 2011 to 2020. A number of computer-aided drug design-related articles (CADDs) from Indonesian journals were collected during the decade, and their trend was analyzed. The results show that there was an increasing trend in the use of CADD programs by Indonesian researchers during those ten years.

Here, we developed a machine learning-enabled pipeline for large-scale virtual screening that promises breakthroughs on both fronts. By clustering compounds according to molecular properties and limited docking against a drug target, the full library was trimmed by 10-fold; the remaining compounds were then screened individually by docking; and finally, a dense neural network was trained to classify the hits into true and false positives.

Hit fragments were identified in a differential scanning fluorimetry-based screen of an in-house library of 755 compounds and subsequently validated in multiple orthogonal biophysical assays, including fluorescence polarization, microscale thermophoresis, and (1)H-(15)N HSQC nuclear magnetic resonance. Extensive structure-activity relationships combined with molecular docking followed by chemical optimization led to the discovery of compound 13, which exhibits micromolar potency and high ligand efficiency (LE = 0.38).

28929756,Fragment-Based Discovery and Optimization of Enzyme Inhibitors by Docking of Commercial Chemical Space.,"Fragment-based lead discovery has emerged as a leading drug development strategy for novel therapeutic targets. Although fragment-based drug discovery benefits immensely from access to atomic-resolution information, structure-based virtual screening has rarely been used to drive fragment discovery and optimization. Here, molecular docking of 0.3 million fragments to a crystal structure of cancer target MTH1 was performed. Twenty-two predicted fragment ligands, for which analogs could be acquired commercially, were experimentally evaluated. Five fragments inhibited MTH1 with IC(50) values ranging from 6 to 79 muM. Structure-based optimization guided by predicted binding modes and analogs from commercial chemical libraries yielded nanomolar inhibitors. Subsequently solved crystal structures confirmed binding modes predicted by docking for three scaffolds. Structure-guided exploration of commercial chemical space using molecular docking gives access to fragment libraries that are several orders of magnitude larger than those screened experimentally and can enable efficient optimization of hits to potent leads.",Journal of medicinal chemistry,2017
35156586,Recent Development in Small Molecules for SARS-CoV-2 and the Opportunity for Fragment-Based Drug Discovery.,"The ongoing pandemic of Covid-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major threat to global public health, drawing attention to develop new therapeutics for treatment. Much research work is focused on identifying or repurposing new small molecules to serve as potential inhibitors by interacting with viral or host-cell molecular targets and understanding the nature of the virus in the host cells. Identifying small molecules as potent inhibitors at an early stage is advantageous in developing a molecule with higher potency and then finding a lead compound for the development of drug discovery. Small molecules can show their inhibition property by targeting either the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) enzyme, papain-like protease (PL(pro)) enzyme, or helicase (Hel), or blocking the spike (S) protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. A very recent outbreak of a new variant (B.1.617.2-termed as Delta variant) of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide posed a greater challenge as it is resistant to clinically undergoing vaccine trials. Thus, the development of new drug molecules is of potential interest to combat SARS-CoV-2 disease, and for that, the fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) approach could be one of the ways to bring out an effective solution. Two cysteine protease enzymes would be an attractive choice of target for fragment-based drug discovery to tune the molecular structure at an early stage with suitable functionality. In this short review, the recent development in small molecules as inhibitors against Covid-19 is discussed, and the opportunity for FBDD is envisioned optimistically to provide an outlook regarding Covid-19 that may pave the way in the direction of the Covid-19 drug development paradigm.",Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),2022
31861445,Use of QSAR Global Models and Molecular Docking for Developing New Inhibitors of c-src Tyrosine Kinase.,"A prototype of a family of at least nine members, cellular Src tyrosine kinase is a therapeutically interesting target because its inhibition might be of interest not only in a number of malignancies, but also in a diverse array of conditions, from neurodegenerative pathologies to certain viral infections. Computational methods in drug discovery are considerably cheaper than conventional methods and offer opportunities of screening very large numbers of compounds in conditions that would be simply impossible within the wet lab experimental settings. We explored the use of global quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and molecular ligand docking in the discovery of new c-src tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using a dataset of 1038 compounds from ChEMBL database, we developed over 350 QSAR classification models. A total of 49 models with reasonably good performance were selected and the models were assembled by stacking with a simple majority vote and used for the virtual screening of over 100,000 compounds. A total of 744 compounds were predicted by at least 50% of the QSAR models as active, 147 compounds were within the applicability domain and predicted by at least 75% of the models to be active. The latter 147 compounds were submitted to molecular ligand docking using AutoDock Vina and LeDock, and 89 were predicted to be active based on the energy of binding.",International journal of molecular sciences,2019

Structure-activity relationships of the coumarin-based hybrids with various bioactivity fragments revealed significant information toward the further development of highly potent and selective disorder therapeutic agents. The molecular docking studies between coumarins and critical therapeutic enzymes demonstrated a mode of action by forming noncovalent interactions with more than one receptor, further rationally confirming information about structure-activity relationships.

36597997,Transformer-based deep learning method for optimizing ADMET properties of lead compounds.,"A successful drug needs to exhibit both effective pharmacodynamics (PD) and safe pharmacokinetics (PK). However, the coordinated optimization of PD and PK properties in molecule generation tasks remains a great challenge for most existing methods, especially when they focus on the pursuit of affinity and selectivity for the lead compound. Thus, molecular optimization for PK properties is a critical step in the drug discovery pipeline, in which absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) property predictive models play an increasingly important role by providing an effective method to assess multiple PK properties of compounds. Here, we proposed a Graph Bert-based ADMET prediction model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) by combining molecular graph features and descriptor features, with 11 tasks ranked first and 20 tasks ranked in the top 3. Based on this prediction model, we trained a Transformer model with multiple properties as constraints for learning the structural transformations involved in MMP and the accompanying property changes. The experimental results show that the trained Constraints-Transformer can implement targeted modifications to the starting molecule, while preserving the core scaffold. Moreover, molecular docking and binding mode analysis demonstrate that the optimized molecules still retain the activity and selectivity for biological targets. Therefore, the proposed method accounts for biological activity and ADMET properties simultaneously. Finally, a webserver containing ADMET property prediction and molecular optimization functions is provided, enabling chemists to improve the properties of starting molecules individually.",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2023
29756561,Advances in the Treatment of Explicit Water Molecules in Docking and Binding Free Energy Calculations.,"BACKGROUND: The inclusion of direct effects mediated by water during the ligandreceptor recognition is a hot-topic of modern computational chemistry applied to drug discovery and development. Docking or virtual screening with explicit hydration is still debatable, despite the successful cases that have been presented in the last years. Indeed, how to select the water molecules that will be included in the docking process or how the included waters should be treated remain open questions. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we will discuss some of the most recent methods that can be used in computational drug discovery and drug development when the effect of a single water, or of a small network of interacting waters, needs to be explicitly considered. RESULTS: Here, we analyse the software to aid the selection, or to predict the position, of water molecules that are going to be explicitly considered in later docking studies. We also present software and protocols able to efficiently treat flexible water molecules during docking, including examples of applications. Finally, we discuss methods based on molecular dynamics simulations that can be used to integrate docking studies or to reliably and efficiently compute binding energies of ligands in presence of interfacial or bridging water molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Software applications aiding the design of new drugs that exploit water molecules, either as displaceable residues or as bridges to the receptor, are constantly being developed. Although further validation is needed, workflows that explicitly consider water will probably become a standard for computational drug discovery soon.",Current medicinal chemistry,2019
36088545,A chronotherapeutics-applicable multi-target therapeutics based on AI: Example of therapeutic hypothermia.,"Nowadays, the complexity of disease mechanisms and the inadequacy of single-target therapies in restoring the biological system have inevitably instigated the strategy of multi-target therapeutics with the analysis of each target individually. However, it is not suitable for dealing with the conflicts between targets or between drugs. With the release of high-precision protein structure prediction artificial intelligence, large-scale high-precision protein structure prediction and docking have become possible. In this article, we propose a multi-target drug discovery method by the example of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). First, we performed protein structure prediction for all protein targets of each group by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. Then, QuickVina 2 is used for molecular docking between the proteins and drugs. After docking, we use PageRank to rank single drugs and drug combinations of each group. The ePharmaLib was used for predicting the side effect targets. Given the differences in the weights of different targets, the method can effectively avoid inhibiting beneficial proteins while inhibiting harmful proteins. So it could minimize the conflicts between different doses and be friendly to chronotherapeutics. Besides, this method also has potential in precision medicine for its high compatibility with bioinformatics and promotes the development of pharmacogenomics and bioinfo-pharmacology.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2022

In this study, using an in silico approach comprised of pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, potential KRAS G12D inhibitors were investigated. A ligand-based common feature pharmacophore model was generated to identify the framework necessary for effective KRAS inhibition. The chemical features in the selected pharmacophore model comprised two hydrogen bond donors, one hydrogen bond acceptor, two aromatic rings and one hydrophobic feature. This model was used for screening in excess of 214,000 compounds from InterBioScreen (IBS) and ZINC databases. Eighteen compounds from the IBS and ten from the ZINC database mapped onto the pharmacophore model and were subjected to molecular docking. Molecular docking results highlighted a higher affinity of four hit compounds towards KRAS G12D in comparison to the reference inhibitor, BI-2852. Sequential molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies revealed all four hit compounds them possess higher KRAS G12D binding free energy and demonstrate stable polar interaction with key residues. Further, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis of the hit compounds in complex with KRAS G12D also indicated stability. Overall, the research undertaken provides strong support for further in vitro testing of these newly identified KRAS G12D inhibitors, particularly Hit1 and Hit2.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022

36499162,ES-Screen: A Novel Electrostatics-Driven Method for Drug Discovery Virtual Screening.,"Electrostatic interactions drive biomolecular interactions and associations. Computational modeling of electrostatics in biomolecular systems, such as protein-ligand, protein-protein, and protein-DNA, has provided atomistic insights into the binding process. In drug discovery, finding biologically plausible ligand-protein target interactions is challenging as current virtual screening and adjuvant techniques such as docking methods do not provide optimal treatment of electrostatic interactions. This study describes a novel electrostatics-driven virtual screening method called 'ES-Screen' that performs well across diverse protein target systems. ES-Screen provides a unique treatment of electrostatic interaction energies independent of total electrostatic free energy, typically employed by current software. Importantly, ES-Screen uses initial ligand pose input obtained from a receptor-based pharmacophore, thus independent of molecular docking. ES-Screen integrates individual polar and nonpolar replacement energies, which are the energy costs of replacing the cognate ligand for a target with a query ligand from the screening. This uniquely optimizes thermodynamic stability in electrostatic and nonpolar interactions relative to an experimentally determined stable binding state. ES-Screen also integrates chemometrics through shape and other physicochemical properties to prioritize query ligands with the greatest physicochemical similarities to the cognate ligand. The applicability of ES-Screen is demonstrated with in vitro experiments by identifying novel targets for many drugs. The present version includes a combination of many other descriptor components that, in a future version, will be purely based on electrostatics. Therefore, ES-Screen is a first-in-class unique electrostatics-driven virtual screening method with a unique implementation of replacement electrostatic interaction energies with broad applicability in drug discovery.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022
31215386,Molecular Docking Study of Active Diazenyl Scaffolds as Inhibitors of Essential Targets Towards Antimicrobial Drug Discovery.,"BACKGROUND: The diazenyl compounds (-N=N- linkage) have been reported to have antimicrobial activity. In modern drug discovery, the drug-receptor interactions are generally explored by the molecular docking studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three categories of diazenyl scaffolds were screened for the docking studies to explore the binding mechanism of interaction with various microbial targets. The diazenyl Schiff bases (SBN-20, SBN-21, SBN-25, SBN-33, SBN-39, SBN-40 and SBN-42), naphthol pharmacophore based diazenyl Schiff bases (NS-2, NS-8, NS-12, NS-15, NS-21, and NS-23), morpholine based diazenyl chalcones (MD-6, MD-9, MD-14, MD-16, MD-20, and MD-21) were docked against various bacterial and fungal proteins in comparison with different standard drugs. Further, the drug likeliness and ADME properties of these molecules were predicted by QikProp module of the Schrodinger software. RESULTS: Most of the derivatives had shown less docking scores and binding energies towards bacterial proteins, such as dihydropteroate synthase (PDB:2VEG), glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (PDB:2VF5), dihydrofolate reductase (PDB:3SRW) in comparison with the standard drugs. The naphthol based diazenyl Schiff bases NS-21 and NS-23 were predicted to act on the cytochrome P450 sterol 14-alpha-demethylase (CYP51) (PDB:5FSA) involved in sterol biosynthesis, an essential target for antifungal drugs. The derivative MD-6, NS-2, NS-21, and NS-23 had shown high docking scores against bacterial DNA topoisomerase (PDB:3TTZ) in comparison with the standard drug ciprofloxacin. Further, most of the synthesized derivatives had shown drug like characters. CONCLUSION: Hence, these compounds can be developed as novel antibacterial agents as potent DNA topoisomerase inhibitors and antifungal agents as CYP51 inhibitors.",Current drug targets,2019

Primarily, 6-substituted-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline derivatives were docked into the active sites of DNA gyrase A&B, to ensure the binding mode of the compounds, and the results were superior on DNA gyrase A over DNA gyrase B. Based on this, S. aureus DNA gyrase A assay was proposed and executed. Most prominent DNA gyrase inhibition showed by 6-fluoro-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline (4c), IC(50) 0.389mug/mL; 2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinolin-6-ol (4e), IC(50) 0.328mug/mL; and 5,7-dichloro-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinolin-6-ol (4h), IC(50) 0.214mug/mL which were substituted with fluorine (4F), nitrile (4CN), hydroxyl group (4OH) and dichloro-hydroxyl (3,5Cl, 4OH) groups in the quinoline scaffold. Antimicrobial activity on Gram(-ve) bacteria Escherichia coli (MTCC 443), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 424), and Gram(+ve) bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 96) and Streptococcus pyogenes (MTCC 442) was evaluated. Excellent antibacterial activity showed by S. aureus and S. pyogenes which indicates the activity dominance of 6-substituted-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline derivatives on Gram(+ve) bacteria rather than Gram(-ve). Subsequently, the cytotoxicity of 6-substituted-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline derivatives was evaluated. Cytotoxicity results of MCF-7 (human breast cancer) and G361 (skin melanoma cancer) cell lines reveals that the 6-substituted-2-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-4-phenylquinoline derivatives are highly toxic to cancer cells.

These diseases are difficult to treat because of the complex nature of the nervous system, and the available medicines are unable to heal them effectively. This fact implies the need for novel therapeutics to be designed that are ready to stop or a minimum of retard the neurodegeneration process. These days, Computer-Assisted Drug Design (CADD) approaches are a passage to extend the drug development efficiency and to reduce time and cost because traditional drug discovery is both time-consuming as well as costly. Computational or in silico methods came up with powerful tools in drug design against neurodegenerative diseases. This review presents the approaches and theoretical basis of CADD.

Yet, the weak binding affinities of these small molecules still represent a challenge for the reliable detection of fragment hits. The extent of this issue was illustrated in the literature for the aspartic protease endothiapepsin: When seven biochemical and biophysical in vitro screening methods were applied to screen a library of 361 fragments, very poor overlap was observed between the hit fragments identified by the individual approaches, resulting in high levels of false positive and/or false negative results depending on the mutually compared methods. Here, the reported in vitro findings are juxtaposed with the results from in silico docking and scoring approaches. The docking programs GOLD and Glide were considered with the scoring functions ASP, ChemScore, ChemPLP, GoldScore, DSX(CSD), and GlideScore. First, the ranking power and scoring power were assessed for the named scoring functions. Second, the capability of reproducing the crystallized fragment binding modes was tested in a structure-based redocking approach. The redocking success notably depended on the ligand efficiency of the considered fragments. Third, a blinded virtual screening approach was employed to evaluate whether in silico screening can compete with in vitro methods in the enrichment of fragment databases.",Archiv der Pharmazie,2024
26302746,A New Scoring Function for Molecular Docking Based on AutoDock and AutoDock Vina.,"Molecular docking of small molecules in the protein binding sites is the most widely used computational technique in modern structure-based drug discovery. Although accurate prediction of binding modes of small molecules can be achieved in most cases, estimation of their binding affinities remains mediocre at best. As an attempt to improve the correlation between the inhibitory constants, pKi, and scoring, we created a new, hybrid scoring function. The new function is a linear combination of the terms of the scoring functions of AutoDock and AutoDock Vina. It was trained on 2,412 protein-ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (www.pdbbind.org.cn, version 2012) and validated on a set of 313 complexes released in the 2013 version as a test set. The new function was included in a modified version of AutoDock. The hybrid scoring function showed a statistically significant improvement in both training and test sets in terms of correlation with and root mean square and mean absolute errors in prediction of pKi values. It was also tested on the CSAR 2014 Benchmark Exercise dataset (team T) and produced reasonably good results.",Current drug discovery technologies,2015
38334015,Elucidation of protein-ligand interactions by multiple trajectory analysis methods.,"The identification of interaction between protein and ligand including binding positions and strength plays a critical role in drug discovery. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) techniques have been widely applied to predict binding positions and binding affinity. However, there are few works that describe the systematic exploration of the MD trajectory evolution in this context, potentially leaving out important information. To address the problem, we build a framework, Moira (molecular dynamics trajectory analysis), which enables automating the whole process ranging from docking, MD simulations and various analyses as well as visualizations. We utilized Moira to analyze 400 MD simulations in terms of their geometric features (root mean square deviation and protein-ligand interaction profiler) and energetics (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) for these trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of different analysis techniques in distinguishing native poses among four poses.",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2024
31578656,Assessing and improving the performance of consensus docking strategies using the DockBox package.,"Molecular docking is a well-established computational technique that aims to predict how a ligand binds to a specific protein target, as well as to assess the strength of the binding. Although docking programs are used worldwide for drug discovery, it is not always simple to identify which program or combination of programs provides the best results for a target of interest. Here we present DockBox, a computational package designed to facilitate the use of multiple docking and scoring programs allowing to combine them using different consensus strategies. As part of the DockBox package, a new consensus docking method called score-based consensus docking (SBCD) is introduced. SBCD was found to significantly improve the pose prediction success rates of single docking programs. When applied to virtual screening, SBCD enhanced enrichment factors while producing higher hit rates than standard consensus docking (CD). SBCD can be run with almost no additional computational cost and time compared to CD, if the same docking programs are used for pose generation. Furthermore, SBCD allows the use of many scoring functions to assess consensus without significant overhead, making it a promising new approach for the screening of large chemical libraries.

However, the latest studies have suggested that over-optimistic results had been reported due to the correlations present in the experimental databases used for training and testing. Here, we investigate the performance of an artificial neural network in binding affinity predictions, comparing results obtained using both experimental protein-ligand structures as well as larger sets of computer-generated structures created using commercial software. Interestingly, similar performances are obtained on both databases. We find a noticeable performance suppression when moving from random horizontal tests to vertical tests performed on target proteins not included in the training data. The possibility to train the network on relatively easily created computer-generated databases leads us to explore per-target scoring functions, trained and tested ad-hoc on complexes including only one target protein. Encouraging results are obtained, depending on the type of protein being addressed.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023

This study presents an integrated approach to identify potential drug targets and screen compounds against this bacterium by leveraging a computational methodology. Subtractive proteomics of the reference strain ASM286196v1/UMB0386 (assembly accession: GCA_002861965.1) facilitated the prioritization of proteins with essential bacterial functions and pathways as potential drug targets. We selected 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase (aroG gene product; also known as DAHP synthase) for downstream analysis. Molecular docking was employed in PyRx (AutoDock Vina) to predict binding affinities between aroG inhibitors from the ZINC database and 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase. Molecular dynamics simulations of 100 ns, using GROMACS, validated the stability of drug-target interactions. Additionally, ADMET profiling aided in the selection of compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile for human hosts. PBPK profiling showed that ZINC98088375 had the highest bioavailability and efficient systemic circulation. Conversely, ZINC5113880 demonstrated the lowest absorption rate (39.661%).

Due to the uprising resistance towards H. pylori infection through the present and common proton pump inhibitors regimens, the investigation of novel candidates is the inevitable issue. Medicinal plants have always been a source of lead compounds for drug discovery. The research of the related effective enzymes linked with this gram-negative bacterium is critical for the discovery of novel drug targets. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to identify the best candidate to evaluate the inhibitory effect of thymoquinone and thymol against H. pylori oncoproteins, Cag A and Vac A in comparison to the standard drug, metronidazole by using a computational approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The targeted oncoproteins, Cag A and Vac A were retrieved from RCSB PDB. Lipinski's rule and ADMET toxicity profiling were carried out on the phytoconstituents of the N. sativa. The two compounds of N. sativa were further analyzed by molecular docking and MD simulation studies. The reported phytoconstituents, thymoquinone and thymol present in N. sativa were docked with H. pylori Cag A and Vac A oncoproteins. Structures of ligands were prepared using ChemDraw Ultra 10 software and then changed into their 3D PDB structures using Molinspiration followed by energy minimization by using software Discovery Studio client 2.5. RESULTS: The docking results revealed the promising inhibitory potential of thymoquinone against Cag A and Vac A with docking energy of -5.81 kcal/mole and -3.61kcal/mole, respectively. On the contrary, the inhibitory potential of thymol against Cag A and Vac A in terms of docking energy was -5.37 kcal/mole and -3.94kcal/mole as compared to the standard drug, metronidazole having docking energy of -4.87 kcal/mole and -3.20 kcal/mole, respectively. Further, molecular dynamic simulations were conducted for 5ns for optimization, flexibility prediction, and determination of folded Cag A and Vac A oncoproteins stability. The Cag A and Vac A oncoproteins-TQ complexes were found to be quite stable with the root mean square deviation value of 0.2nm. CONCLUSION: The computational approaches suggested that thymoquinone and thymol may play an effective pharmacological role to treat H. pylori infection. Hence, it could be summarized that the ligands thymoquinone and thymol bound and interacted well with the proteins Cag A and Vac A as compared to the ligand MTZ.

Here, using pan-genomics, a total of 1,387 core proteins were identified. Subtractive proteome analyses further identified 12 proteins that are vital for bacteria. One membrane protein (secY) and two cytoplasmic proteins (asd and trpG) were chosen as possible therapeutic targets concerning minimum % host identity, essentiality, and other cutoff values, such as high resistance in the MDR S. aureus. The UniProt AA sequences of the selected targets were modelled and docked against 3 drug-like chemical libraries.

39096284,Repurposing Anidulafungin for Alzheimer's Disease via Fragment-Based Drug Discovery.,"The misfolding and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides have been implicated as key pathogenic events in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting Abeta aggregation represents a potential disease-modifying therapeutic approach to AD treatment. Previous studies have identified various molecules that inhibit Abeta aggregation, some of which share common chemical substructures (fragments) that may be key to their inhibitory activity. Employing fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) methods may facilitate the identification of these fragments, which can subsequently be used to screen new inhibitors and provide leads for further drug development. In this study, we used an in silico FBDD approach to identify 17 fragment clusters that are significantly enriched among Abeta aggregation inhibitors. These fragments were then used to screen anti-infective agents, a promising drug class for repurposing against amyloid aggregation. This screening process identified 16 anti-infective drugs, 5 of which were chosen for further investigation. Among the 5 candidates, anidulafungin, an antifungal compound, showed high efficacy in inhibiting Abeta aggregation in vitro. Kinetic analysis revealed that anidulafungin selectively blocks the primary nucleation step of Abeta aggregation, substantially delaying Abeta fibril formation. Cell viability assays demonstrated that anidulafungin can reduce the toxicity of oligomeric Abeta on BV2 microglia cells. Molecular docking simulations predicted that anidulafungin interacted with various Abeta species, including monomers, oligomers, and fibrils, potentially explaining its activity against Abeta aggregation and toxicity. This study suggests that anidulafungin is a potential drug to be repurposed for AD, and FBDD is a promising approach for discovering drugs to combat Abeta aggregation.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2024

In this review, we comprehensively surveyed the prospective applications of molecular docking judged by solid experimental validations in the literature over the past fifteen years. Herein, we systematically analyzed the novelty of the targets and the docking hits, practical protocols of docking screening, and the following experimental validations. Among the 419 case studies we reviewed, most virtual screenings were carried out on widely studied targets, and only 22% were on less-explored new targets. Regarding docking software, GLIDE is the most popular one used in molecular docking, while the DOCK 3 series showed a strong capacity for large-scale virtual screening. Besides, the majority of identified hits are promising in structural novelty and one-quarter of the hits showed better potency than 1 muM, indicating that the primary advantage of SBVS is to discover new chemotypes rather than highly potent compounds. Furthermore, in most studies, only in vitro bioassays were carried out to validate the docking hits, which might limit the further characterization and development of the identified active compounds. Finally, several successful stories of SBVS with extensive experimental validations have been highlighted, which provide unique insights into future SBVS drug discovery campaigns.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022

The transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) family of transcription factors acts as a receptor for downstream effectors, namely yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which binds to various transcription factors and is essential for stimulated gene transcription. YAP/TAZ-TEAD facilitates the upregulation of multiple genes involved in evolutionary cell proliferation and survival. TEAD1-4 overexpression has been observed in different cancers in various tissues, making TEAD an attractive target for drug development. The central drug-accessible pocket of TEAD is crucial because it undergoes a post-translational modification called auto-palmitoylation. Crystal structures of the C-terminal TEAD complex with small molecules are available in the Protein Data Bank, aiding structure-based drug design. In this study, we utilized the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, shape-based screening, and molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) calculations for virtual screening, and we identified a novel non-covalent inhibitor-BC-001-with IC(50) = 3.7 muM in a reporter assay.

Increasing drug resistant for antileishmanial drugs such as miltefosine, sodium stibogluconate and pentamidine has been reported in the VL endemic region. Amphotericin B has shown potential antileishmanial activity in different formulations but its cost of treatment and associated nephrotoxicity have limited its use by affected people living in the endemic zone. To control the VL infection in the affected countries, it is necessary to develop new antileishmanial compounds with high efficacy and negligible toxicity. Computer aided programs such as binding free energy estimation; ADMET prediction and molecular dynamics simulation can be used to investigate novel antileishmanial molecules in shorter duration. To develop antileishmanial lead molecule, we performed standard precision (SP) docking for 1160 benzoxaborole analogs along with reference inhibitors against trypanothione reductase of Leishmania parasite. Furthermore, extra precision (XP) docking, ADMET prediction, prime MM-GBSA was conducted over 115 ligands, showing better docking score than reference inhibitors to get potential antileishmanial compounds. Simultaneously, area under the curve (AUC) was estimated using ROC plot to validate the SP and XP docking protocol.

Cereblon is a well-known target of thalidomide and its derivatives. Cereblon is involved in multiple myeloma cell apoptosis. When ligands such as thalidomide and lenalidomide bind to cereblon, it recognizes various neosubstrates based on the ligand shape and properties. We have identified novel CRBN inhibitors, namely DHFO and its analogs, with structural features that are slightly different from thalidomide but stronger cereblon-binding affinity. We selected indanedione and indanone derivatives from the literature to understand and compare their cereblon-mediated substrate recognition potential. METHODS: Computational investigations of possible CRBN inhibitors were investigated by molecular docking with Autodock Vina and DockThor programs. The properties of the compounds' ADME/T and drug-likeness were investigated. A molecular dynamics study was carried out for four selected molecules, and the molecular interactions were analyzed using PCA-based FEL methods. The binding affinity was calculated using the MM/PBSA method. RESULTS: We conducted computational investigations on 68 indanedione and indanone derivatives binding with cereblon. Ten molecules showed better CRBN binding affinity than thalidomide. We studied the drug-likeness properties of the selected ten molecules, and four of the most promising molecules (DHFO, THOH, DIMS, and DTIN) were chosen for molecular dynamics studies. The MM/PBSA calculations showed that the DHFO, already shown to be a 5-LOX/COX2 inhibitor, has the highest binding affinity of - 163.16 kJ/mol with cereblon. CONCLUSION: The selected CRBN inhibitor DHFO has demonstrated the highest binding affinity with cereblon protein compared to other molecules. Thalidomide and its derivatives have a new substitute in the form of DHFO, which produces an interaction hotspot on the surface of the cereblon. Ease of chemical synthesis, low toxicity, versatile therapeutic options, and pleiotropism of DHFO analogs provide an opportunity for exploring clinical alternatives with versatile therapeutic potential for a new category of indanedione molecules as novel modulators of E3 ubiquitin ligases.",Computational biology and chemistry,2022
25193260,Virtual screening: an in silico tool for interlacing the chemical universe with the proteome.,"In silico screening both in the forward (traditional virtual screening) and reverse sense (inverse virtual screening (IVS)) are helpful techniques for interlacing the chemical universe of small molecules with the proteome. The former, which is using a protein structure and a large chemical database, is well-known by the scientific community. We have chosen here to provide an overview on the latter, focusing on validation and target prioritization strategies. By comparing it to complementary or alternative wet-lab approaches, we put IVS in the broader context of chemical genomics, target discovery and drug design. By giving examples from the literature and an own example on how to validate the approach, we provide guidance on the issues related to IVS.","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2015
30039408,Dynamic Undocking: A Novel Method for Structure-Based Drug Discovery.,"Computer-aided methods have been broadly used in pharmaceutical research to identify potential ligands and design effective therapeutics. Most of the approaches rely on the binding affinity prediction and approximate thermodynamic properties of the system. Our alternative approach focuses on structural stability, provided by native protein-ligand interactions, in particular hydrogen bonds. Based on this idea, we designed new fast computational method, called dynamic undocking (DUck), that evaluates stability by calculating the work necessary to break the most important native contact in a ligand-receptor complex. This property is effective in distinguishing true ligands from decoys and is orthogonal to currently existing docking methods, thus making it exceptionally useful in virtual screening. Here, we present a protocol suitable for DUck's application in drug design strategy, as well as notes that will help to solve common problems addressed by users.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018
33867348,"In-silico pharmacophoric and molecular docking-based drug discovery against the Main Protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, a causative agent COVID-19.","COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) caused by a novel 'SARS-CoV-2' virus resulted in public health emergencies across the world. An effective vaccine to cure this virus is not yet available, thus requires concerted efforts at various scales. In this study, we employed Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) based approach to identify the drug-like compounds - inhibiting the replication of the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. Our database search using an online tool ""ZINC pharmer"" retrieved ~1500 compounds based on pharmacophore features. Lipinski's rule was applied to further evaluate the drug-like compounds, followed by molecular docking-based screening, and the selection of screening ligand complex with M(pro) based on S-score (higher than reference inhibitor) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value (less than reference inhibitor) using AutoDock 4.2. Resultantly, ~200 compounds were identified having strong interaction with M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. After evaluating their binding energy using the AutoDock 4.2 software, three compounds (ZINC20291569, ZINC90403206, ZINC95480156) were identified that showed highest binding energy with M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 and strong inhibition effect than the N3 (reference inhibitor). A good binding energy, drug likeness and effective pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that these candidates have greater potential to stop the replication of SARS-CoV-2, hence might lead to the cure of COVID-19.",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2020
26774287,Identification of estrogen receptor alpha ligands with virtual screening techniques.,"Utilization of computer-aided molecular discovery methods in virtual screening (VS) is a cost-effective approach to identify novel bioactive small molecules. Unfortunately, no universal VS strategy can guarantee high hit rates for all biological targets, but each target requires distinct, fine-tuned solutions. Here, we have studied in retrospective manner the effectiveness and usefulness of common pharmacophore hypothesis, molecular docking and negative image-based screening as potential VS tools for a widely applied drug discovery target, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha). The comparison of the methods helps to demonstrate the differences in their ability to identify active molecules. For example, structure-based methods identified an already known active ligand from the widely-used bechmarking decoy molecule set. Although prospective VS against one commercially available database with around 100,000 drug-like molecules did not retrieve many testworthy hits, one novel hit molecule with pIC50 value of 6.6, was identified. Furthermore, our small in-house compound collection of easy-to-synthesize molecules was virtually screened against ERalpha, yielding to five hit candidates, which were found to be active in vitro having pIC50 values from 5.5 to 6.5.",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2016
28432980,Discovery of potential inhibitor against human acetylcholinesterase: a molecular docking and molecular dynamics investigation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of central nervous system among elderly people. Human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), an important enzyme in neuronal signaling, is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine which in turn prevents the post synaptic signal transmissions. hAChE has been an attractive target of drug discovery for the search of therapeutics against AD. In the recent past hAChE has become hot target for the investigation of new potential therapeutics. We performed virtual screening of entire database against hAChE. Further, the extra precision molecular docking was carried out to refine the docking results and the best complex was passed for molecular dynamics simulations in order of understanding the hAChE dynamics and its behavior in complex with the ligand which corroborate the outcomes of virtual screening. This also provides binding free energy data that establishes the ligands efficiency for inhibiting hAChE. The computational findings discussed in this paper provide initial information of inhibitory effects of ligand, (drugbank entry DB00983), over hAChE.",Computational biology and chemistry,2017
27709317,Docking-undocking combination applied to the D3R Grand Challenge 2015.,"Novel methods for drug discovery are constantly under development and independent exercises to test and validate them for different goals are extremely useful. The drug discovery data resource (D3R) Grand Challenge 2015 offers an excellent opportunity as an external assessment and validation experiment for Computer-Aided Drug Discovery methods. The challenge comprises two protein targets and prediction tests: binding mode and ligand ranking. We have faced both of them with the same strategy: pharmacophore-guided docking followed by dynamic undocking (a new method tested experimentally here) and, where possible, critical assessment of the results based on pre-existing information. In spite of using methods that are qualitative in nature, our results for binding mode and ligand ranking were amongst the best on Hsp90. Results for MAP4K4 were less positive and we track the different performance across systems to the level of previous knowledge about accessible conformational states. We conclude that docking is quite effective if supplemented by dynamic undocking and empirical information (e.g. binding hot spots, productive protein conformations). This setup is well suited for virtual screening, a frequent application that was not explicitly tested in this edition of the D3R Grand Challenge 2015. Protein flexibility remains as the main cause for hard failures.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2016
37922151,"Screening of potential inhibitors of Leishmania major N-myristoyltransferase from Azadirachta indica phytochemicals for leishmaniasis drug discovery by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory methods.","Leishmaniasis is one of the most neglected parasitic diseases worldwide. The toxicity of current drugs used for its treatment is a major obstacle to their effectiveness, necessitating the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents for better disease control. In Leishmania parasites, N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) has been identified as a promising target for drug development. Thus, exploring well-known medicinal plants such as Azadirachta indica and their phytochemicals can offer a diverse range of treatment options, potentially leading to disease prevention and control. To assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds, their ADMET prediction and drug-likeness properties were analyzed. The top 4 compounds were selected which had better and significantly low binding energy than the reference molecule QMI. Based on the binding energy score of the top compounds, the results show that Isonimocinolide has the highest binding affinity (-9.8 kcal/mol). In addition, a 100 ns MD simulation of the four best compounds showed that Isonimocinolide and Nimbolide have good stability with LmNMT. These compounds were then subjected to MMPBSA (last 30 ns) calculation to analyze protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior. Nimbolide and Meldenin showed lowest binding free energy i.e. -84.301 kJ/mol and -91.937 kJ/mol respectively. DFT was employed to calculate the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, global reactivity parameters, and molecular electrostatic potential of all hit molecules. The promising results obtained from MD simulations and MMPBSA analyses provide compelling evidence for the potential use of these compounds in future drug development efforts for the treatment of leishmaniasis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In this research, in-silico drug discovery approaches via quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and molecular docking simulations were adapted to 43 compounds of indazole derivatives with HDAC inhibition for anticancer activity against breast cancer. The QSAR models were built from multiple linear regression (MLR), and models predictability was cross-validated by leave-one-out (LOO) method. Based on these results, compounds C32, C26 and C31 from model 3 showed superior inhibitory activity with pIC(50) of 9.30103, 9.1549 and 9.1549. We designed 10 novel compounds with molecular docking scores ranging from -7.9 to -9.3 kcal/mol. The molecular docking simulation results reveal that amino acid residues ILE1122 and PRO1123 play a significant role in bonding with 6CE6 protein. Furthermore, newly designed compounds P5, P2 and P7 with high docking scores of -9.3 kcal/mol, -8.9 kcal/mol and -8.8 kcal/mol than FDA-approved drug Raloxifene (-8.5 kcal/mol) and aid in establishment of potential drug candidate for HDAC inhibitors. The in-silico ADME functionality is used in the final phase to evaluate newly designed inhibitors as potential drug candidates.

To this end, however, required collective information is not yet available on a single platform. Hence, we have developed the DenvInD database for experimentally validated DENV inhibitors against its known targets presently hosted at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/denvind/. This database provides comprehensive information, i.e. PubChem IDs, SMILES, IC50, EC50, CC50, and wherever available Ki values of the 484 compounds in vitro validated as inhibitors against respective drug targets of DENV. Also, the DenvInD database has been linked to the user-friendly web-based interface and accessibility features, such as simple search, advanced search and data browsing. All the required data curation was conducted manually from the reported scientific literature and PubChem. The collected information was then organized into the DenvInD database using sequence query language under user interface by hypertext markup language. DenvInD is the first useful repository of its kind which would augment the DENV drug discovery research by providing essential information on known DENV inhibitors for molecular docking, computational screening, pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2021

26025037,Panel docking of small-molecule libraries - Prospects to improve efficiency of lead compound discovery.,"Computational docking as a means to prioritise small molecules in drug discovery projects remains a highly popular in silico screening approach. Contemporary docking approaches without experimental parametrisation can reliably differentiate active and inactive chemotypes in a protein binding site, but the absence of a correlation between the score of a predicted binding pose and the biological activity of the molecule presents a clear limitation. Several novel or improved computational approaches have been developed in the recent past to aid in screening and profiling of small-molecule ligands for drug discovery, but also more broadly in developing conceptual relationships between different protein targets by chemical probing. Among those new methodologies is a strategy known as inverse virtual screening, which involves the docking of a compound into different protein structures. In the present article, we review the different computational screening methodologies that employ docking of atomic models, and, by means of a case study, present an approach that expands the inverse virtual screening concept. By computationally screening a reasonably sized library of 1235 compounds against a panel of 48 mostly human kinases, we have been able to identify five groups of putative lead compounds with substantial diversity when compared to each other. One representative of each of the five groups was synthesised, and tested in kinase inhibition assays, yielding two compounds with micro-molar inhibition in five human kinases. This highly economic and cost-effective methodology holds great promise for drug discovery projects, especially in cases where a group of target proteins share high structural similarity in their binding sites.",Biotechnology advances,2015
31276975,Mechanism of action of celastrol against rheumatoid arthritis: A network pharmacology analysis.,"Network pharmacology uses bioinformatics to broaden our understanding of drug actions and thereby to advance drug discovery. Here we apply network pharmacology to generate testable hypotheses about the multi-target mechanism of celastrol against rheumatoid arthritis. We reconstructed drug-target pathways and networks to predict the likely protein targets of celastrol and the main interactions between those targets and the drug. Then we validated our predictions of four candidate targets (IKK-beta, JNK, COX-2, MEK1) by performing docking studies with celastrol. The results suggest that celastrol acts against rheumatoid arthritis by regulating the function of several signaling proteins, including MMP-9, COX-2, c-Myc, TGF-beta, c-JUN, JAK-1, JAK-3, IKK-beta, SYK, MMP-3, JNK and MEK1, which regulate the functions of Th1 and Th2 cells, macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Celastrol is predicted to affect networks involved mainly in cancer, connective tissue disorders, organismal injury and abnormalities, tissue development, cell death and survival.

27765367,Herbalog: A tool for target-based identification of herbal drug efficacy through molecular docking.,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, molecular docking is primarily employed to screen pure compounds; the top-ranking chemicals are subsequently selected for experimental validation. Unlike synthetic chemicals, most natural products are commercially unavailable. The isolation and purification of each natural product is extremely time-consuming, which has restricted the screening of lead compounds from natural products. PURPOSE: We developed a protocol, Herbalog, to facilitate the identification of bioactive phytochemicals through molecular docking. METHODS: We wrote a script using Python and Autodock Vina for docking; ligand displacement and adipolysis assays were used to determine the anti-fatty acid binding protein (FABP) 4 activity of bioactive extracts. An ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry system was applied for identifying major peaks of bioactive extracts. RESULTS: Herbalog, a natural product database, contains 5,112 phytochemicals from 197 common herbs and a script that counts the number of hits from docking in each herb and calculates the hit rate of herbs. Herbalog prioritizes herbs according to their hit rates, and top-ranking herb candidates contain a large repertoire of hits. We used Herbalog as a screening tool and identified labdane diterpenoids from Andrographis paniculata as leading candidates of FABP4 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Herbalog facilitates the discovery of herbs that possess the highest number of inhibitors or activators against target proteins, which reduces the sample preparation time for preliminary validation.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2016
27862041,Screening of tyrosinase inhibitors by capillary electrophoresis with immobilized enzyme microreactor and molecular docking.,"A new method for screening tyrosinase inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) was successfully developed by capillary electrophoresis with reliable online immobilized enzyme microreactor (IMER). In addition, molecular docking study has been used for supporting inhibition interaction between enzyme and inhibitors. The IMER of tyrosinase was constructed at the outlet of the capillary by using glutaraldehyde as cross-linker. The parameters including enzyme reaction, separation of the substrate and product, and the performance of immobilized tyrosinase were investigated systematically. Because of using short-end injection procedure, the product and substrate were effectively separated within 2 min. The immobilized tyrosinase could remain 80% active for 30 days at 4 degrees C. The Michaelis-Menten constant of tyrosinase was determined as 1.78 mM. Kojic acid, a known tyrosinase inhibitor, was used as a model compound for the validation of the inhibitors screening method. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of kojic acid was 5.55 muM. The method was successfully applied for screening tyrosinase inhibitors from 15 compounds of TCM. Four compounds including quercetin, kaempferol, bavachinin, and bakuchiol were found having inhibitory potentials. The results obtained in this work were supported by molecular docking study.",Electrophoresis,2017

In turn, drug design process, especially the fragment-based approaches, could benefit from the knowledge. Retrospective virtual screening campaigns by employing AutoDock Vina followed by protein-ligand interaction fingerprinting (PLIF) identification by using recently published PyPLIF HIPPOS were the main techniques used here. The ligands and decoys datasets from the enhanced version of the database of useful decoys (DUDE) targeting human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were employed in this research since the mutation data are available and could be used to retrospectively verify the prediction. The results show that the method presented in this article could pinpoint some retrospectively verified molecular determinants. The method is therefore suggested to be employed as a routine in drug design and discovery.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
33759124,Negative Image-Based Screening: Rigid Docking Using Cavity Information.,"Rational drug discovery relies heavily on molecular docking-based virtual screening, which samples flexibly the ligand binding poses against the target protein's structure. The upside of flexible docking is that the geometries of the generated docking poses are adjusted to match the residue alignment inside the target protein's ligand-binding pocket. The downside is that the flexible docking requires plenty of computing resources and, regardless, acquiring a decent level of enrichment typically demands further rescoring or post-processing. Negative image-based screening is a rigid docking technique that is ultrafast and computationally light but also effective as proven by vast benchmarking and screening experiments. In the NIB screening, the target protein cavity's shape/electrostatics is aligned and compared against ab initio-generated ligand 3D conformers. In this chapter, the NIB methodology is explained at the practical level and both its weaknesses and strengths are discussed candidly.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2021
38884365,In Silico Prediction of Potential Inhibitors for Targeting RNA CAG Repeats via Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation: A Drug Discovery Approach.,"Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a rare neurological illness inherited dominantly that causes severe impairment and premature mortality. While each rare disease may affect individuals infrequently, collectively they pose a significant healthcare challenge. It is mainly carried out due to the expansion of RNA triplet (CAG) repeats, although missense or point mutations can also be induced. Unfortunately, there is no cure; only symptomatic treatments are available. To date, SCA has about 48 subtypes, the most common of these being SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, and 17 having CAG repeats. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, this study seeks to investigate effective natural herbal neuroprotective compounds against CAG repeats, which are therapeutically significant in treating SCA. Initially, virtual screening followed by molecular docking was used to estimate the binding affinity of neuroprotective natural compounds toward CAG repeats. The compound with the highest binding affinity, somniferine, was then chosen for MD simulation. The structural stability, interaction mechanism, and conformational dynamics of CAG repeats and somniferine were investigated via MD simulation. The MD study revealed that during the simulation period, the interaction between CAG repeats and somniferine stabilizes and results in fewer conformational variations. This in silico study suggests that Somniferine can be used as a therapeutic medication against RNA CAG repeats in SCA.",Journal of cellular biochemistry,2024

Scoring functions used in molecular docking often fail to simulate complex protein-ligand interactions fully and accurately leading to biases and inaccuracies in virtual screening and target predictions. We introduce the ""Docking Score ML"", developed from an analysis of over 200,000 docked complexes from 155 known targets for cancer treatments. The scoring functions used are founded on bioactivity data sourced from ChEMBL and have been fine-tuned using both supervised machine learning and deep learning techniques. We validated our approach extensively using multiple data sets such as validation of selectivity mechanism, the DUDE, DUD-AD, and LIT-PCBA data sets, and performed a multitarget analysis on drugs like sunitinib. To enhance prediction accuracy, feature fusion techniques were explored.

38806453,Structure prediction of protein-ligand complexes from sequence information with Umol.,"Protein-ligand docking is an established tool in drug discovery and development to narrow down potential therapeutics for experimental testing. However, a high-quality protein structure is required and often the protein is treated as fully or partially rigid. Here we develop an AI system that can predict the fully flexible all-atom structure of protein-ligand complexes directly from sequence information. We find that classical docking methods are still superior, but depend upon having crystal structures of the target protein. In addition to predicting flexible all-atom structures, predicted confidence metrics (plDDT) can be used to select accurate predictions as well as to distinguish between strong and weak binders. The advances presented here suggest that the goal of AI-based drug discovery is one step closer, but there is still a way to go to grasp the complexity of protein-ligand interactions fully.

34448628,Phytoconstituents and Medicinal Plants for Anticancer Drug Discovery: Computational Identification of Potent Inhibitors of PIM1 Kinase.,"Natural products, medicinal plants, and phytoconstituents serve as important sources and accelerators for anticancer drug discovery, especially when they are combined with virtual screening and molecular simulations against molecular drug targets. Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim1 (PIM1) is involved in cell survival and proliferation, with great relevance for oncogenesis. PIM1 plays a major role in the progression of various common complex human cancers, including prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematopoietic malignancies. The overexpression of PIM1 leads to cancer progression, and thus it is considered as a potential target for drug design and development purposes. Here, we report original in silico findings by employing structure-based virtual screening to discover potential phytoconstituents from the medicinal plants-based compounds, which could inhibit the PIM1 activity, using the IMPPAT (a curated database of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics) database. The initial hits were selected based on their binding affinity toward PIM1 calculated through the molecular docking approach. Subsequently, interaction analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns was carried out to study the conformational dynamics and complex stability of PIM1 with the identified compounds. Importantly, we found that PIM1 forms stable protein-ligand complexes with the phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin in particular. Our findings suggest that identified phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin bind to PIM1 in ATP-competitive binding mode.

36307750,Combined Bioinformatics and Combinatorial Chemistry Tools to Locate Drug-Able Anti-TB Phytochemicals: A Cost-Effective Platform for Natural Product-Based Drug Discovery.,"Based on extensive experimental studies, a huge number of phytochemicals showed potential activity against tuberculosis (TB) at a lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and fewer toxicity profiles. However, these promising drugs have not been able to convert from 'lead' to 'mainstream' due to inadequate drug-ability profiles. Thus, early drug-prospective analyses are required at the primary stage to accelerate natural-product-based drug discovery with limited resources and time. In the present study, we have selected seventy-three potential anti-TB phytochemicals (MIC value </=10 mug/mL) and assessed the drug-ability profiles using bioinformatics and combinatorial chemistry tools, systematically. Primarily, the molecular docking study was done against two putative drug targets, catalase-peroxidase enzyme (katG) and RNA polymerase subunit-beta (rpoB) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using AutoDock 4.2 software. Further, assessed the drug-ability score from Molsoft, toxicity profiles from ProTox, pharmacokinetics from SwisADME, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) by ChemMine tools and frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) with Avogadro and structural activity relationships (SAR) analysis with ChemDraw 18.0 software. Above analyses indicated that, lower MIC exhibited anti-TB phytochemicals, abietane, 12-demethylmulticaulin exhibited poor docking and drug-ability scores, while tiliacorinine, 2-nortiliacorinine showed higher binding energy and drug-ability profiles. Overall, tiliacorinine, 2-nortiliacorinine, 7alpha-acetoxy-6beta-hydroxyroyleanone (AHR), (2S)-naringenin and isovachhalcone were found as the most active and drug-able anti-TB candidates from 73 candidates. Phytochemicals are always a vital source of mainstream drugs, but the MIC value of a phytochemical is not sufficient for it to be promoted. An ideal drug-ability profile is therefore essential for achieving clinical success, where advanced bioinformatics tools help to assess and analyse that profile. Additionally, several natural pharmacophores found in existing anti-TB drugs in SAR analyses also provide crucial information for developing potential anti-TB drug. As a conclusion, combined bioinformatics and combinatorial chemistry are the most effective strategies to locate potent-cum-drug-able candidates in the current drug-development module.",Chemistry & biodiversity,2022
38739228,Determination of promising inhibitors for N-SH2 domain of SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase: an in silico study.,"There are many genes that produce proteins related to diseases and these proteins can be targeted with drugs as a potential therapeutic approach. Recent advancement in drug discovery techniques have created new opportunities for treating variety of diseases by targeting disease-related proteins. Structure-based drug discovery is a faster and more cost-effective approach than traditional methods. SHP2 phosphatase, encoded by the PTPN11 gene, has been the focus of much attention due to its involvement in many types of diseases. The biological function of SHP2 is enabled mostly by protein-protein interaction through its SH2 domains. In this study, we report the identification of a potential small molecule inhibitor for the N-SH2 domain of SHP2 by structure-based drug discovery approach. We utilized molecular docking studies, followed by molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA calculations, to analyze compounds retrieved from the Broad's Drug Repurposing Hub and ZINC15 databases. We selected 10 hit compounds with the best docking scores from the libraries and examined their binding properties in the N-SH2 domain. We found that compound CID 60838 (Irinotecan) was the most suitable compound with a binding free energy value of - 64.45 kcal/mol and significant interactions with the target residues in the domain.",Molecular diversity,2024
39263808,Tetraasteranes as homologues of cubanes: effective scaffolds for drug discovery.,"Classical hydrocarbon scaffolds have long assisted in bringing new molecules to the market for a variety of applications, but one notable omission is that of tetraasteranes, which are homologues of cubanes belonging to a class of polycyclic hydrocarbon cage compounds. Tetraasteranes exhibit potential as scaffolds in drug discovery due to their identical cyclobutane structures and rigid conformation resembling cubanes. Based on the studies of the physical and chemical properties of tetraasteranes by density functional theory, three series of compounds were designed as homologues of cubanes by the substitution of cubane scaffolds in pharmaceuticals with tetraasteranes. Their potential for pharmaceutical applications was evaluated in silico by molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Their pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties were studied by the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis. The results indicate that tetraasteranes may be scaffolds as novel bioisosteres of cubanes, as well as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, which enhance the affinity between ligands and receptors with more stable binding behavior and feasible tolerability in ADMET.

In the domain of computer-aided drug discovery, deep learning has emerged as a prominent technique in molecular modeling. Deep generative models, based on deep learning, play a crucial role in generating novel molecules when optimizing molecules. However, many existing molecular generative models have limitations as they solely process input information in a forward way. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved generative model called BD-CycleGAN, which incorporates BiLSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) and Mol-CycleGAN (molecular cycle generative adversarial network) to preserve the information of molecular input. To evaluate the proposed model, we assess its performance by analyzing the structural distribution and evaluation matrices of generated molecules in the process of structural transformation. The results demonstrate that the BD-CycleGAN model achieves a higher success rate and exhibits increased diversity in molecular generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application in molecular docking, where it successfully increases the docking score for the generated molecules. The proposed BD-CycleGAN architecture harnesses the power of deep learning to facilitate the generation of molecules with desired structural features, thus offering promising advancements in the field of drug discovery processes.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2024
33170521,Step toward repurposing drug discovery for COVID-19 therapeutics through in silico approach.,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become a threat to global health and has led to a global economic crisis. Although the researchers worldwide are putting tremendous effort toward gaining more insights into this zoonotic virus and developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs, no vaccine or drug is yet available to combat COVID-19 effectively. Drug discovery is often a laborious, time-consuming, and expensive task. In this time of crisis, employing computational methods could provide a feasible alternative approach that can potentially be used for drug discovery. Therefore, a library of several antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory drugs was virtually screened against SARS-CoV-2 proteases to identify potential inhibitors. The identified inhibitory drugs were further analyzed to confirm their activities against SARS-CoV-2. Our results could prove to be helpful in repurposing the drug discovery approach, which could substantially reduce the expenses, time, and resources required.",Drug development research,2021

It is of interest to evaluate the intrinsic performance of scoring functions, independently of conformational exploration, to understand their strengths and weaknesses and suggest improvements. The comparative assessment of scoring functions (CASF) provides such an evaluation. Here we add the AutoDock and Vina scoring functions to the CASF-2013 benchmark. We find that these popular, free software docking programs are generally in the first half (AutoDock) and first quarter (Vina) among all methods tested in CASF-2013.

34888727,Creating Maps of the Ligand Binding Landscape for Kinetics-Based Drug Discovery.,"Simulations of ligand-protein interactions can be very useful for drug design and to gain biological insight. Full pathways of ligand-protein binding can be used to get information about ligand binding transition states, which form the rate-limiting step of the binding and release processes. However, these simulations are typically limited by the presence of large energy barriers that separate stable poses of interest. Here we describe a simulation protocol for exploring and analyzing landscapes of ligand-protein interactions that makes use of molecular docking, enhanced molecular simulation with the weighted ensemble algorithm, and network analysis. It can be accomplished using a modest cluster of graphics processing units and freely accessible software. This protocol focuses on the construction and analysis of a network model of ligand binding poses and provides links to resources that describe the other steps in more detail. The end result of this protocol is a map of the ligand-protein binding landscape that identifies transition states of the ligand binding pathway, as well as alternative bound poses that could be stabilized with modifications to the ligand.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2022
36309139,Multi-target-based polypharmacology prediction (mTPP): An approach using virtual screening and machine learning for multi-target drug discovery.,"Polypharmacology has become a new paradigm in drug discovery and plays an increasingly vital role in discovering multi-target drugs. In this context, multi-target drugs are a promising approach to treating polygenic diseases. Many in-silico prediction methods have been developed to screen active molecules acting on multiple targets. The relationship between the action of multiple targets and the drug's overall efficacy is significant for developing multi-target drugs. So, the prediction method for this relationship urgently needs to be developed. This paper introduces multi-target-based polypharmacology prediction (mTPP), an approach using virtual screening and machine learning to explore the relationship. To predict the activity of the potential hepatoprotective components, the data on the binding strength of a single ingredient with multiple targets and the proliferation rate of the compounds against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced injury L02 cells were all used to construct the mTPP model by Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vactor Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), and Gradient Boost Regression (GBR) algorithms. Compared with MLP, SVR, and DTR algorithms, GBR algorithms showed the best performance with R(2)(test) = 0.73 and EV(test) = 0.75. In addition, 20 candidates with potential effects against drug-induced liver injury (DILI) were predicted by the mTPP model. Furthermore, 2 of the 20 candidates, Chelerythrine and Biochanin A, were applied to evaluate the model's accuracy. The results showed that Chelerythrine and Biochanin A could improve the viability of APAP-induced injury cells. Thus, the mTPP model is hoped to help develop polypharmacology and discover multi-target drugs.",Chemico-biological interactions,2022
37424186,Structure based virtual screening and discovery of novel inhibitors against FabD protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"The highly flexible nature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can be owed to its tough cell wall and multiple gene interaction system which makes it resistant to frontline TB drugs. Mycolic acids are the key components of the unique cell wall that protects the organism from external threats. Proteins of the fatty acid synthesis pathway are evolutionarily conserved that enables cellular survival in harsh conditions and hence have become attractive targets. Malonyl Co-A Acyl carrier protein transacylase (FabD; MCAT, EC2.3.1.39) is an enzyme in the branching point of the unique and vast fatty acid synthase (FAS-I and FAS-II) systems of Mtb. In the present investigation, in-silico structure based drug discovery with the compounds from an open source library (NPASS) is used for target fishing and employed to understand the interaction with the target protein FabD. The potential hit compounds were filtered using exhaustive docking, considering the binding energy, key residue interaction and drug likeness property. Three compounds from the library namely NPC475074 (Hit 1), NPC260631 (Hit 2) and NPC313985 (Hit 3) with binding energies -14.45, -13.29 and -12.37 respectively were taken for molecular dynamic simulation. The results suggested that Hit 3 (NPC313985) has stable interaction with FabD protein. This article further elaborates the interaction of the identified novel compounds Hit 1 and Hit 3 along with the other known compound (Hit 2) against Mtb FabD protein. The hit compounds identified from this study could be further evaluated against mutated FabD protein and considered for in-vitro evaluation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Therefore, drug discovery studies for these diseases have focused on the protein conversion process. We used a structure-based drug discovery algorithm (termed Nagasaki University Docking Engine: NUDE) that ran on an intensive supercomputer with a graphic-processing unit to identify several compounds with anti-prion effects. Among the candidates showing a high-binding score, the compounds exhibited direct interaction with recombinant PrP in vitro, and drastically reduced PrP(Sc) and protein-aggresomes in the prion-infected cells. The fragment molecular orbital calculation showed that the van der Waals interaction played a key role in PrP(C) binding as the intermolecular interaction mode. Furthermore, PrP(Sc) accumulation and microgliosis were significantly reduced in the brains of treated mice, suggesting that the drug candidates provided protection from prion disease, although further in vivo tests are needed to confirm these findings. This NUDE-based structure-based drug discovery for normal protein structures is likely useful for the development of drugs to treat other conformational disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.",EBioMedicine,2016

Numerous studies have shown that compared with broad-spectrum HDACs inhibitors, selective HDAC6 inhibitors exert ideal efficacy in tumor treatment with insignificant toxic and side effects, demonstrating promising clinical application prospect. Herein, we carried out rational drug design by integrating a deep learning model, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation technology to construct a virtual screening process. The designed derivatives with 5-phenyl-1H-indole fragment as Cap showed desirable cytotoxicity to the various tumor cell lines, all of which were within 15 muM (ranging from 0.35 to 14.87 muM), among which compound 5i had the best antiproliferative activities against HL-60 (IC(50) = 0.35 +/- 0.07 muM) and arrested HL-60 cells in the G0/G1 phase. In addition, 5i exhibited better isotype selective inhibitory activities due to the potent potency against HDAC6 (IC(50) = 5.16 +/- 0.25 nM) and the reduced inhibitory activities against HDAC1 (selective index  approximately  124), which was further verified by immunoblotting results. Moreover, the representative binding conformation of 5i on HDAC6 was revealed and the key residues contributing 5i's binding were also identified via decomposition free-energy analysis.

31855781,Application of an integrated cheminformatics-molecular docking approach for discovery for physicochemically similar analogs of fluoroquinolones as putative HCV inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is a major public health concern across the globe. At present, direct-acting antivirals are the treatment of choice. However, the long-term effect of this therapy has yet to be ascertained. Previously, fluoroquinolones have been reported to inhibit HCV replication by targeting NS3 protein. Therefore, it is logical to hypothesize that the natural analogs of fluoroquinolones will exhibit NS3 inhibitory activity with substantially lesser side effects. METHOD: In this study, we tested the application of a recently devised integrated in-silico Cheminformatics-Molecular Docking approach to identify physicochemically similar natural analogs of fluoroquinolones from the available databases (Ambinter, Analyticon, Indofines, Specs, and TimTec). Molecular docking and ROC curve analyses were performed, using PatchDock and Graphpad software, respectively, to compare and analyze drug-protein interactions between active natural analogs, Fluoroquinolones, and HCV NS3 protein. RESULT: In our analysis, we were able to shortlist 18 active natural analogs, out of 10,399, that shared physicochemical properties with the template drugs (fluoroquinolones). These analogs showed comparable binding efficacy with fluoroquinolones in targeting 32 amino acids in the HCV NS3 active site that are crucial for NS3 activity. Our approach had around 80 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity in identifying physicochemically similar analogs of fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: Our current data suggest that our approach can be efficiently applied to identify putative HCV drug inhibitors that can be taken for in vitro testing. This approach can be applied to discover physicochemically similar analogs of virtually any drug, thus providing a speedy and inexpensive approach to complement drug discovery and design, which can tremendously economize on time and money spent on the screening of putative drugs.",Computational biology and chemistry,2020

BACKGROUND: Monocarboxylate Transporter 8 (MCT8) is a Thyroid Hormone (TH) transporter which is highly expressed in the liver and brain. Mutations in the MCT8 gene (SLC16A2) cause a syndrome of psychomotor retardation in humans, known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). Currently, no treatment is available for AHDS. Therefore, there is a need to discover new inhibitors of MCT8 for treating AHDS. OBJECTIVE: Considering the importance of natural compounds in drug discovery, this study aimed to identify potential natural inhibitors against MCT8. METHODS: As Protein-ligand interactions play a key role in structure based drug design, this study screened 24 natural kinase inhibitors and investigated their binding affinity against MCT8 by using molecular docking. The modelled 3D structure of MCT8 docked with 24 compounds using PyRX through Autodock Vina. Drug-likeness studies were made using Swiss ADME and Lipinski's rule of five was performed.

RESULT: The results showed that emodin exhibited best binding energy of -8.6 kcal/mol followed by helenaquinol, cercosporamide and resveratrol. Moreover, it was observed that emodin and helenaquinol exhibit higher binding energy than the positive controls. Cercosporamide and resveratrol exhibited higher binding energy than triac and desipramine and showed the binding energy similar to silychristin.

34577052,Exploring EZH2-Proteasome Dual-Targeting Drug Discovery through a Computational Strategy to Fight Multiple Myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell neoplastic disease representing about 10-15% of all haematological malignancies diagnosed in developed countries. Proteasome is a key player in multiple myeloma and proteasome inhibitors are the current first-line of treatment. However, these are associated with limited clinical efficacy due to acquired resistance. One of the solutions to overcome this problem is a polypharmacology approach, namely combination therapy and multitargeting drugs. Several polypharmacology avenues are currently being explored. The simultaneous inhibition of EZH2 and Proteasome 20S remains to be investigated, despite the encouraging evidence of therapeutic synergy between the two. Therefore, we sought to bridge this gap by proposing a holistic in silico strategy to find new dual-target inhibitors. First, we assessed the characteristics of both pockets and compared the chemical space of EZH2 and Proteasome 20S inhibitors, to establish the feasibility of dual targeting. This was followed by molecular docking calculations performed on EZH2 and Proteasome 20S inhibitors from ChEMBL 25, from which we derived a predictive model to propose new EZH2 inhibitors among Proteasome 20S compounds, and vice versa, which yielded two dual-inhibitor hits. Complementarily, we built a machine learning QSAR model for each target but realised their application to our data is very limited as each dataset occupies a different region of chemical space. We finally proceeded with molecular dynamics simulations of the two docking hits against the two targets. Overall, we concluded that one of the hit compounds is particularly promising as a dual-inhibitor candidate exhibiting extensive hydrogen bonding with both targets. Furthermore, this work serves as a framework for how to rationally approach a dual-targeting drug discovery project, from the selection of the targets to the prediction of new hit compounds.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
39729673,Integrated computational biophysics approach for drug discovery against Nipah virus.,"The Nipah virus (NiV) poses a pressing global threat to public health due to its high mortality rate, multiple modes of transmission, and lack of effective treatments. NiV glycoprotein G (NiV-G) emerges as a promising target for the discovery of NiV drugs because of its essential role in viral entry and membrane fusion. Therefore, in this study, we applied an integrated computational and biophysics approach to identify potential inhibitors of NiV-G within a curated dataset of Peruvian phytochemicals. The virtual screening results indicated that these compounds could represent a natural source of potential NiV-G inhibitors with DeltaG values ranging from -8 to -11 kcal/mol. Among them, procyanidin B2, B3, B7, and C1 exhibited the highest binding affinities and formed the most molecular interactions with NiV-G. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the induced-fit mechanism of NiV-G pocket interaction with these procyanidins, primarily driven by its hydrophobic nature. Non-equilibrium free energy calculations were used to determine binding affinities, highlighting Procyanidin B3 and B2 as the ligands with the most substantial interactions. In general, this work underscores the potential of Peruvian phytochemicals, particularly procyanidins B2, B3, B7, and C1, as lead compounds for developing anti-NiV drugs through an integrated computational biophysics approach.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2025

31640190,A Machine Learning-Based Prediction Platform for P-Glycoprotein Modulators and Its Validation by Molecular Docking.,"P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an important determinant of multidrug resistance (MDR) because its overexpression is associated with increased efflux of various established chemotherapy drugs in many clinically resistant and refractory tumors. This leads to insufficient therapeutic targeting of tumor populations, representing a major drawback of cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, P-gp is a target for pharmacological inhibitors to overcome MDR. In the present study, we utilized machine learning strategies to establish a model for P-gp modulators to predict whether a given compound would behave as substrate or inhibitor of P-gp. Random forest feature selection algorithm-based leave-one-out random sampling was used. Testing the model with an external validation set revealed high performance scores. A P-gp modulator list of compounds from the ChEMBL database was used to test the performance, and predictions from both substrate and inhibitor classes were selected for the last step of validation with molecular docking. Predicted substrates revealed similar docking poses than that of doxorubicin, and predicted inhibitors revealed similar docking poses than that of the known P-gp inhibitor elacridar, implying the validity of the predictions.

A focus on cyclic compounds, particularly natural compounds with diverse scaffolds, provides important insights into novel molecular structures for drug design. However, the complexity of their ring structures has hindered the applicability of widely accepted methods and software for the systematic identification and classification of cyclic compounds. Herein, we successfully developed a new method, D3Rings, to identify acyclic, monocyclic, spiro ring, fused and bridged ring, and cage ring compounds, as well as macrocyclic compounds. By using D3Rings, we completed the statistics of cyclic compounds in three different databases, e.g., ChEMBL, DrugBank, and COCONUT. The results demonstrated the richness of ring structures in natural products, especially spiro, macrocycles, and fused and bridged rings. Based on this, three deep generative models, namely, VAE, AAE, and CharRNN, were trained and used to construct two data sets similar to DrugBank and COCONUT but 10 times larger than them. The enlarged data sets were then used to explore the molecular chemical space, focusing on complex ring structures, for novel drug discovery and development. Docking experiments with the newly generated COCONUT-like data set against three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins revealed that an expanded compound database improves molecular docking results. Cyclic structures exhibited the best docking scores among the top-ranked docking molecules. These results suggest the importance of exploring the chemical space of structurally novel cyclic compounds and continuous expansion of the library of drug-like compounds to facilitate the discovery of potent ligands with high binding affinity to specific targets.

33946965,Predicting Accurate Lead Structures for Screening Molecular Libraries: A Quantum Crystallographic Approach.,"Optimization of lead structures is crucial for drug discovery. However, the accuracy of such a prediction using the traditional molecular docking approach remains a major concern. Our study demonstrates that the employment of quantum crystallographic approach-counterpoise corrected kernel energy method (KEM-CP) can improve the accuracy by and large. We select human aldose reductase at 0.66 A, cyclin dependent kinase 2 at 2.0 A and estrogen receptor beta at 2.7 A resolutions with active site environment ranging from highly hydrophilic to moderate to highly hydrophobic and several of their known ligands. Overall, the use of KEM-CP alongside the GoldScore resulted superior prediction than the GoldScore alone. Unlike GoldScore, the KEM-CP approach is neither environment-specific nor structural resolution dependent, which highlights its versatility. Further, the ranking of the ligands based on the KEM-CP results correlated well with that of the experimental IC(50) values. This computationally inexpensive yet simple approach is expected to ease the process of virtual screening of potent ligands, and it would advance the drug discovery research.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
39547062,Extension of impurity profiling on eltrombopag olamine to in-silico predictions: An effort to exploit correlated forced degradation products and known drug-related substances in drug discovery.,"The recent pandemic has highlighted the impact of diseases on global health and the economy. The rapid discovery of new hit molecules remains a tough challenge. Pharmaceutical impurity profiling can be linked to drug discovery through the identification of new hits from compounds identified during the analytical profiling. The present study demonstrates this linkage through the extension of the impurity (forced degradation) profiling of eltrombopag (ELT) olamine, a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist. The drug was exposed to standard degradation and the degradation products were primarily resolved and identified by UPLC-ESI-MS. This led to the identification of five forced degradation products (FDP). Thirty-three other known related substances (RS) of ELT, identified in the literature, were also considered. Molecular similarity checks were performed using Tanimoto/Jaccard's similarity searches. A set of structurally and topologically similar molecules, including ELT and 15 RS, was established and subjected to in-silico toxicity-, absorption-, distribution-, metabolism-, and elimination (ADME) predictions. The RS, predicted with similar or lower toxicity than ELT and a comparable ADME profile, were subjected to molecular docking to trace changes in TPO receptor affinity. The results indicated that five RS had a high Jaccard's similarity with ELT and higher or comparable docking scores. These compounds, along with few other impurities were predicted to have lower toxicity, better or comparable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and also a better excretion profile than ELT. This justifies their entry as potential novel TPO receptor agonists in drug discovery.","Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2024

SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that kappa-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and beta-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150.

38924082,MTMol-GPT: De novo multi-target molecular generation with transformer-based generative adversarial imitation learning.,"De novo drug design is crucial in advancing drug discovery, which aims to generate new drugs with specific pharmacological properties. Recently, deep generative models have achieved inspiring progress in generating drug-like compounds. However, the models prioritize a single target drug generation for pharmacological intervention, neglecting the complicated inherent mechanisms of diseases, and influenced by multiple factors. Consequently, developing novel multi-target drugs that simultaneously target specific targets can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and address issues related to resistance mechanisms. To address this issue and inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, we propose an upgraded GPT model with generative adversarial imitation learning for multi-target molecular generation called MTMol-GPT. The multi-target molecular generator employs a dual discriminator model using the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method for a concurrently multi-target molecular generation. Extensive results show that MTMol-GPT generates various valid, novel, and effective multi-target molecules for various complex diseases, demonstrating robustness and generalization capability. In addition, molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping experiments demonstrate the drug-likeness properties and effectiveness of generated molecules potentially improve neuropsychiatric interventions. Furthermore, our model's generalizability is exemplified by a case study focusing on the multi-targeted drug design for breast cancer.

38319801,Extracting binding energies and binding modes from biomolecular simulations of fragment binding to endothiapepsin.,"Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) aims to discover a set of small binding fragments that may be subsequently linked together. Therefore, in-depth knowledge of the individual fragments' structural and energetic binding properties is essential. In addition to experimental techniques, the direct simulation of fragment binding by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations became popular to characterize fragment binding. However, former studies showed that long simulation times and high computational demands per fragment are needed, which limits applicability in FBDD. Here, we performed short, unbiased MD simulations of direct fragment binding to endothiapepsin, a well-characterized model system of pepsin-like aspartic proteases. To evaluate the strengths and limitations of short MD simulations for the structural and energetic characterization of fragment binding, we predicted the fragments' absolute free energies and binding poses based on the direct simulations of fragment binding and compared the predictions to experimental data. The predicted absolute free energies are in fair agreement with the experiment. Combining the MD data with binding mode predictions from molecular docking approaches helped to correctly identify the most promising fragments for further chemical optimization. Importantly, all computations and predictions were done within 5 days, suggesting that MD simulations may become a viable tool in FBDD projects.",Archiv der Pharmazie,2024
31785932,Pharmaceutical analysis combined with in-silico therapeutic and toxicological profiling on zileuton and its impurities to assist in modern drug discovery.,"The obligatory testing of drug molecules and their impurities to protect users against toxic compounds seems to provide interesting opportunities for new drug discovery. Impurities, which proved to be non-toxic, may be explored for their own therapeutic potential and thus be a part of future drug discovery. The essential role of pharmaceutical analysis can thus be extended to achieve this purpose. The present study examined these objectives by characterizing the major degradation products of zileuton (ZLT), a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor being prevalently used to treat asthma. The drug sample was exposed to forced degradation and found susceptible to hydrolysis and oxidative stress. The obtained Forced Degradation Products (FDP's) were resolved using an earlier developed and validated Ultra-High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography Photo-Diode-Array (UHPLC-PDA) protocol. ZLT, along with acid-and alkali-stressed samples, were subjected to Liquid-chromatography Mass-spectrometry Quadrupole Time-of-flight (LC/MS-QTOF) studies. Major degradation products were isolated using Preparative TLC and characterized using Q-TOF and/or Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)HNMR) studies. The information obtained was assembled for structural conformation. Toxicity Prediction using Komputer Assisted Technology (TOPKAT) toxicity analyses indicated some FDP's as non-toxic when compared to ZLT. Hence, these non-toxic impurities may have bio-affinity and can be explored to interact with other therapeutic targets, to assist in drug discovery. The drug molecule and the characterized FDP's were subjected to 3-Dimensional Extra Precision (3D-XP)-molecular docking to explore changes in bio-affinity for the 5-LOX enzyme (PDB Id: 3V99). One FDP was found to have a higher binding affinity than the drug itself, indicating it may be a suitable antiasthmatic. The possibility of being active at other sites cannot be neglected and this is evaluated to a reasonable extent by Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS). Besides being antiasthmatic, some FDP's were predicted antineoplastic, antiallergic and inhibitors of Complement Factor-D.",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2020

Innovation in computer-aided drug design is primarily driven by structure- and ligand-based approaches. When the number of known inhibitors for a target is limited, data augmentation strategies are often preferred to enhance model performance. In this study, we developed predictive machine learning models for structure-based drug discovery leveraging multiple traditional machine learning algorithms trained with target and ligand dynamics-aware datasets. To illustrate our approach, we present a composite model that combines classification and regression to predict YTHDF1 inhibitors, utilizing PLEC features. YTHDF1, a key m(6)A reader protein involved in mRNA translation, is implicated in various cancers, making it a promising therapeutic target. Traditional structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) using generic scoring functions has struggled to identify potent YTHDF1 inhibitors due to the protein's unique binding characteristics. To overcome this, we developed YTHDF1-specific machine learning scoring functions (MLSFs) to enhance SBVS efficacy. We employed various data augmentation techniques to generate a comprehensive dataset, incorporating multiple conformations of ligands and the YTHDF1 protein. We have trained 64 YTHDF1-specific MLSFs using four machine learning algorithms and evaluated them on ten test sets, focusing on their predictive and ranking power. Our results demonstrate that the artificial neural network with protein-ligand extended connectivity fingerprints (ANN-PLEC) outperforms other MLSFs, consistently achieving high area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.87. This method shows promise for targets with limited quantities of active molecules, providing a viable path forward for drug discovery research.

CHK1 coordinates cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage, facilitating repair of single-strand breaks, and maintains the genome integrity in response to replication stress. In this study, we employed an integrated computational and experimental approach to drug discovery and repurposing, aiming to identify a potent CHK1 inhibitor among existing drugs. An e-pharmacophore model was developed based on the three-dimensional crystal structure of the CHK1 protein in complex with CCT245737. This model, characterized by seven key molecular features, guided the screening of a library of drugs through molecular docking. The top 10% of scored ligands were further examined, with procaterol emerging as the leading candidate. Procaterol demonstrated interaction patterns with the CHK1 active site similar to CHK1 inhibitor (CCT245737), as shown by molecular dynamics analysis. Subsequent in vitro assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell cycle analysis, were conducted on gastric adenocarcinoma cells treated with procaterol, both as a monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin. Procaterol, in synergy with cisplatin, significantly inhibited cell growth, suggesting a potentiated therapeutic effect. Thus, we propose the combined application of cisplatin and procaterol as a novel potential therapeutic strategy against human gastric cancer.

This study employs ensemble learning models to identify crucial substructures as significant features for drug development. Using molecular docking techniques, a collection of 160 darunavir (DRV) analogs was designed based on these key substructures and subsequently screened using molecular docking techniques. Chemical structures with high fitness scores were selected, combined, and one-dimensional (1D) screening based on beyond Lipinski's rule of five (bRo5) and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) prediction implemented in the Combined Analog generator Tool (CAT) program. A total of 473 screened analogs were subjected to docking analysis through convolutional neural networks scoring function against both the wild-type (WT) and 12 major mutated PRs. DRV analogs with negative changes in binding free energy ( DeltaDeltaGbind ) compared to DRV could be categorized into four attractive groups based on their interactions with the majority of vital PRs. The analysis of interaction profiles revealed that potent designed analogs, targeting both WT and mutant PRs, exhibited interactions with common key amino acid residues. This observation further confirms that the ML model-guided approach effectively identified the substructures that play a crucial role in potent analogs. It is expected to function as a powerful computational tool, offering valuable guidance in the identification of chemical substructures for synthesis and subsequent experimental testing.",Journal of computational chemistry,2024

In this study, an approach by ultrafiltration LC-MS and molecular docking was used to screen and identify tyrosinase inhibitors from Semen Oroxyli extract. The samples were first incubated with the tyrosinase to select the optimal binding conditions including tyrosinase concentration, incubation time and the molecular weight of ultrafiltration membrane. By comparison of the chromatographic profiles of the extracts after ultrafiltration with activated and inactivated tyrosinase, the potential inhibitors were obtained and then identified by LC-MS. The relative binding affinities of the potential inhibitors were also calculated based on the decrease of peak areas of those. As a result, seven compounds were fished out as tyrosinase inhibitors by this assay. Among them, oroxin A and baicalein showed higher tyrosinase inhibitory than resveratrol as positive drug, and their binding mode with enzyme was further verified via the molecular docking analysis. The test results showed that the proposed method was a simple, rapid, effective, and reliable method for the discovery of natural bioactive compounds, and it can be extended to screen other bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines.",Journal of chromatographic science,2019

The CDK8 inhibitors are actively sought after, especially among natural products. We performed a virtual screening using the ZINC library comprising approximately 90,000 natural compounds. We applied Lipinski's rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties, and pan-assay interference compounds filter to eliminate promiscuous binders. Subsequently, the filtered compounds underwent molecular docking to predict their binding affinity and interactions with the CDK8 protein. Interaction analysis were carried out to elucidate the interaction mechanism of the screened hits with binding pockets of the CDK8. The ZINC02152165, ZINC04236005, and ZINC02134595 were selected with appreciable specificity and affinity with CDK8. An all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulation followed by essential dynamics was performed for 200 ns.

36903561,Rational Computational Approaches in Drug Discovery: Potential Inhibitors for Allosteric Regulation of Mutant Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-1 Enzyme in Cancers.,"Mutations in homodimeric isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes at specific arginine residues result in the abnormal activity to overproduce D-2 hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is often projected as solid oncometabolite in cancers and other disorders. As a result, depicting the potential inhibitor for D-2HG formation in mutant IDH enzymes is a challenging task in cancer research. The mutation in the cytosolic IDH1 enzyme at R132H, especially, may be associated with higher frequency of all types of cancers. So, the present work specifically focuses on the design and screening of allosteric site binders to the cytosolic mutant IDH1 enzyme. The 62 reported drug molecules were screened along with biological activity to identify the small molecular inhibitors using computer-aided drug design strategies. The designed molecules proposed in this work show better binding affinity, biological activity, bioavailability, and potency toward the inhibition of D-2HG formation compare to the reported drugs in the in silico approach.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023

The trademark pathologies of AD are the presence of amyloid aggregates in neurofibrils. Recently phytochemicals being considered as potential inhibitors against various neurodegenerative, antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral diseases in human beings. OBJECTIVE: This study targets the inhibition of BACE-1 by phytochemicals using in silico drug discovery analysis. METHODS: A total of 3150 phytochemicals were collected from almost 25 different plants through literature assessment. The ADMET studies, molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) based analysis were performed to analyze the potential inhibitory properties of these phytochemicals. RESULTS: The ADMET and docking results exposed seven compounds that have high potential as an inhibitory agent against BACE-1 and show binding affinity >8.0 kcal/mol against BACE-1. They show binding affinity greater than those of various previously reported inhibitors of BACE-1. Furthermore, DFT based analysis has shown high reactivity for these seven phytochemicals in the binding pocket of BACE- 1, based on ELUMO, EHOMO and Kohn-Sham energy gap. All seven phytochemicals were testified (as compared to experimental ones) as novel inhibitors against BACE-1. CONCLUSION: Out of seven phytochemicals, four were obtained from plant Glycyrrhiza glabra i.e. Shinflavanone, Glabrolide, Glabrol and PrenyllicoflavoneA, one from Huperzia serrate i.e. Macleanine, one from Uncaria rhynchophylla i.e. 3a-dihydro-cadambine and another one was from VolvalerelactoneB from plant Valeriana-officinalis.

37307967,Definition of fatty acid transport protein-2 (FATP2) structure facilitates identification of small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of diabetic complications.,"Diabetes is a major public health problem due to morbidity and mortality associated with end organ complications. Uptake of fatty acids by Fatty Acid Transport Protein-2 (FATP2) contributes to hyperglycemia, diabetic kidney and liver disease pathogenesis. Because FATP2 structure is unknown, a homology model was constructed, validated by AlphaFold2 prediction and site-directed mutagenesis, and then used to conduct a virtual drug discovery screen. In silico similarity searches to two low-micromolar IC(50) FATP2 inhibitors, followed by docking and pharmacokinetics predictions, narrowed a diverse 800,000 compound library to 23 hits. These candidates were further evaluated for inhibition of FATP2-dependent fatty acid uptake and apoptosis in cells. Two compounds demonstrated nanomolar IC(50), and were further characterized by molecular dynamic simulations. The results highlight the feasibility of combining a homology model with in silico and in vitro screening, to economically identify high affinity inhibitors of FATP2, as potential treatment for diabetes and its complications.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2023

26897747,1001 Ways to run AutoDock Vina for virtual screening.,"Large-scale computing technologies have enabled high-throughput virtual screening involving thousands to millions of drug candidates. It is not trivial, however, for biochemical scientists to evaluate the technical alternatives and their implications for running such large experiments. Besides experience with the molecular docking tool itself, the scientist needs to learn how to run it on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures, and understand the impact of the choices made. Here, we review such considerations for a specific tool, AutoDock Vina, and use experimental data to illustrate the following points: (1) an additional level of parallelization increases virtual screening throughput on a multi-core machine; (2) capturing of the random seed is not enough (though necessary) for reproducibility on heterogeneous distributed computing systems; (3) the overall time spent on the screening of a ligand library can be improved by analysis of factors affecting execution time per ligand, including number of active torsions, heavy atoms and exhaustiveness. We also illustrate differences among four common HPC infrastructures: grid, Hadoop, small cluster and multi-core (virtual machine on the cloud). Our analysis shows that these platforms are suitable for screening experiments of different sizes. These considerations can guide scientists when choosing the best computing platform and set-up for their future large virtual screening experiments.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2016

It is especially important in the rational design of compounds with desired polypharmacology or selectivity profiles. To address this problem, we present a methodology for the development of target-specific scoring functions possessing high screening power.

The Deep Neural Network models achieve the external test AUC ROC values of 0.96 and 0.93 for the random split and 0.90 and 0.84 for the time-based split of the PI3Kalpha and tankyrase inhibitors, respectively. In addition, the impact of the training set size and the actives/decoys ratio on the model quality was assessed. The study demonstrates that the optimized scoring functions could significantly improve the docking screening power for each individual target. This is very useful in the design of multitarget or selective drugs wherein the screening filters are applied in sequence.",Molecular informatics,2018

However, current methods are often limited by the topological regularities of drug molecules, making them difficult to generalize to a broader chemical space. Additionally, the use of similarity to measure DTI network links often introduces noise, leading to false DTI relationships and affecting the prediction accuracy. To address these issues, this study proposes an Adaptive Iterative Graph Optimization (AIGO)-DTI prediction framework. This framework integrates atomic cluster information and enhances molecular features through the design of functional group prompts and graph encoders, optimizing the construction of DTI association networks. Furthermore, the optimization of graph structure is transformed into a node similarity learning problem, utilizing multihead similarity metric functions to iteratively update the network structure to improve the quality of DTI information. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of AIGO-DTI on multiple public data sets and label reversal data sets. Case studies, molecular docking, and existing research validate its effectiveness and reliability. Overall, the method proposed in this study can construct comprehensive and reliable DTI association network information, providing new graphing and optimization strategies for DTI prediction, which contribute to efficient drug development and reduce target discovery costs.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024
38416513,ESSENCE-Dock: A Consensus-Based Approach to Enhance Virtual Screening Enrichment in Drug Discovery.,"Drug development is a complex, costly, and time-consuming endeavor. While high-throughput screening (HTS) plays a critical role in the discovery stage, it is one of many factors contributing to these challenges. In certain contexts, virtual screening can complement the HTS, potentially offering a more streamlined approach in the initial stages of drug discovery. Molecular docking is an example of a popular virtual screening technique that is often used for this purpose; however, its effectiveness can vary greatly. This has led to the use of consensus docking approaches that combine results from different docking methods to improve the identification of active compounds and reduce the occurrence of false positives. However, many of these methods do not fully leverage the latest advancements in molecular docking. In response, we present ESSENCE-Dock (Effective Structural Screening ENrichment ConsEnsus Dock), a new consensus docking workflow aimed at decreasing false positives and increasing the discovery of active compounds.

37948198,"Identification of potential molecular targets and repurposed drugs for tuberculosis using network-based screening approach, molecular docking, and simulation.","The spread of drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis has hampered efforts to control the disease worldwide. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall envelope is dynamic, with complex features that protect it from the host immunological response. As a result, the bacterial cell wall components represent a potential target for drug discovery. Protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) are critical for understanding disease conditions and identifying precise therapeutic targets. We used a rational theoretical approach by constructing a PPIN with the proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The PPIN was constructed through the STRING database and embB was identified as a key protein by using four topological measures, betweenness, closeness, degree, and eigenvector, in the CytoNCA tool in Cytoscape. The 'Drug repurposing' approach was employed to find suitable inhibitors against embB. We used the Schrodinger suites for molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculations to validate the binding of protein with the ligand. FDA-approved drugs from the ZINC database and DrugBank were screened against embB (PDB ID: 7BVF) using high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision docking. The drugs were screened based on the XP docking score of the standard drug ethambutol. Accordingly, from the top five hits, azilsartan and dihydroergotamine were selected based on the binding free energy values and were further subjected to Molecular Dynamics Simulation studies for 100 ns. Our study confirms that Azilsartan and Dihydroergotamine form stable complexes with embB and can be used as potential lead molecules based on further in vitro and in vivo experimental validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

36698208,DeepMPF: deep learning framework for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-modal representation with meta-path semantic analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction has become a crucial prerequisite in drug design and drug discovery. However, the traditional biological experiment is time-consuming and expensive, as there are abundant complex interactions present in the large size of genomic and chemical spaces. For alleviating this phenomenon, plenty of computational methods are conducted to effectively complement biological experiments and narrow the search spaces into a preferred candidate domain. Whereas, most of the previous approaches cannot fully consider association behavior semantic information based on several schemas to represent complex the structure of heterogeneous biological networks. Additionally, the prediction of DTI based on single modalities cannot satisfy the demand for prediction accuracy. METHODS: We propose a multi-modal representation framework of 'DeepMPF' based on meta-path semantic analysis, which effectively utilizes heterogeneous information to predict DTI. Specifically, we first construct protein-drug-disease heterogeneous networks composed of three entities. Then the feature information is obtained under three views, containing sequence modality, heterogeneous structure modality and similarity modality. We proposed six representative schemas of meta-path to preserve the high-order nonlinear structure and catch hidden structural information of the heterogeneous network. Finally, DeepMPF generates highly representative comprehensive feature descriptors and calculates the probability of interaction through joint learning. RESULTS: To evaluate the predictive performance of DeepMPF, comparison experiments are conducted on four gold datasets. Our method can obtain competitive performance in all datasets. We also explore the influence of the different feature embedding dimensions, learning strategies and classification methods. Meaningfully, the drug repositioning experiments on COVID-19 and HIV demonstrate DeepMPF can be applied to solve problems in reality and help drug discovery. The further analysis of molecular docking experiments enhances the credibility of the drug candidates predicted by DeepMPF. CONCLUSIONS: All the results demonstrate the effectively predictive capability of DeepMPF for drug-target interactions. It can be utilized as a useful tool to prescreen the most potential drug candidates for the protein.

Mycobacterial DNA gyrase B subunit has been identified to be one of the potentially underexploited drug targets in the field of anti-tubercular drug discovery. To design the novel and potent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) inhibitors, we performed molecular modeling studies that combined the 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations. Forty eight quinoline-aminopiperidine inhibitors which act on DNA gyrase B subunit were used for constructing 3D-QSAR models.

29016123,ProSelection: A Novel Algorithm to Select Proper Protein Structure Subsets for in Silico Target Identification and Drug Discovery Research.,"Molecular docking is widely applied to computer-aided drug design and has become relatively mature in the recent decades. Application of docking in modeling varies from single lead compound optimization to large-scale virtual screening. The performance of molecular docking is highly dependent on the protein structures selected. It is especially challenging for large-scale target prediction research when multiple structures are available for a single target. Therefore, we have established ProSelection, a docking preferred-protein selection algorithm, in order to generate the proper structure subset(s). By the ProSelection algorithm, protein structures of ""weak selectors"" are filtered out whereas structures of ""strong selectors"" are kept. Specifically, the structure which has a good statistical performance of distinguishing active ligands from inactive ligands is defined as a strong selector. In this study, 249 protein structures of 14 autophagy-related targets are investigated. Surflex-dock was used as the docking engine to distinguish active and inactive compounds against these protein structures. Both t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to distinguish the strong from the weak selectors based on the normality of the docking score distribution. The suggested docking score threshold for active ligands (SDA) was generated for each strong selector structure according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The performance of ProSelection was further validated by predicting the potential off-targets of 43 U.S. Federal Drug Administration approved small molecule antineoplastic drugs.

39337622,Reliability of AlphaFold2 Models in Virtual Drug Screening: A Focus on Selected Class A GPCRs.,"Protein three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction is one of the most challenging issues in the field of computational biochemistry, which has overwhelmed scientists for almost half a century. A significant breakthrough in structural biology has been established by developing the artificial intelligence (AI) system AlphaFold2 (AF2). The AF2 system provides a state-of-the-art prediction of protein structures from nearly all known protein sequences with high accuracy. This study examined the reliability of AF2 models compared to the experimental structures in drug discovery, focusing on one of the most common protein drug-targeted classes known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) class A. A total of 32 representative protein targets were selected, including experimental structures of X-ray crystallographic and Cryo-EM structures and their corresponding AF2 models. The quality of AF2 models was assessed using different structure validation tools, including the pLDDT score, RMSD value, MolProbity score, percentage of Ramachandran favored, QMEAN Z-score, and QMEANDisCo Global. The molecular docking was performed using the Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking (GOLD) software. The AF2 models' reliability in virtual drug screening was determined by their ability to predict the ligand binding poses closest to the native binding pose by assessing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) metric and docking scoring function. The quality of the docking and scoring function was evaluated using the enrichment factor (EF). Furthermore, the capability of using AF2 models in molecular docking to identify hits with key protein-ligand interactions was analyzed. The posing power results showed that the AF2 models successfully predicted ligand binding poses (RMSD < 2 A). However, they exhibited lower screening power, with average EF values of 2.24, 2.42, and 1.82 for X-ray, Cryo-EM, and AF2 structures, respectively. Moreover, our study revealed that molecular docking using AF2 models can identify competitive inhibitors. In conclusion, this study found that AF2 models provided docking results comparable to experimental structures, particularly for certain GPCR targets, and could potentially significantly impact drug discovery.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024
25682781,The importance of employing computational resources for the automation of drug discovery.,"INTRODUCTION: The application of computational tools to drug discovery helps researchers to design and evaluate new drugs swiftly with a reduce economic resources. To discover new potential drugs, computational chemistry incorporates automatization for obtaining biological data such as adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), as well as drug mechanisms of action. AREAS COVERED: This editorial looks at examples of these computational tools, including docking, molecular dynamics simulation, virtual screening, quantum chemistry, quantitative structural activity relationship, principal component analysis and drug screening workflow systems. The authors then provide their perspectives on the importance of these techniques for drug discovery. EXPERT OPINION: Computational tools help researchers to design and discover new drugs for the treatment of several human diseases without side effects, thus allowing for the evaluation of millions of compounds with a reduced cost in both time and economic resources. The problem is that operating each program is difficult; one is required to use several programs and understand each of the properties being tested. In the future, it is possible that a single computer and software program will be capable of evaluating the complete properties (mechanisms of action and ADMET properties) of ligands. It is also possible that after submitting one target, this computer-software will be capable of suggesting potential compounds along with ways to synthesize them, and presenting biological models for testing.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2015
39379930,DrugReAlign: a multisource prompt framework for drug repurposing based on large language models.,"Drug repurposing is a promising approach in the field of drug discovery owing to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Most current drug repurposing models rely on specific datasets for training, which limits their predictive accuracy and scope. The number of both market-approved and experimental drugs is vast, forming an extensive molecular space. Due to limitations in parameter size and data volume, traditional drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction models struggle to generalize well within such a broad space. In contrast, large language models (LLMs), with their vast parameter sizes and extensive training data, demonstrate certain advantages in drug repurposing tasks. In our research, we introduce a novel drug repurposing framework, DrugReAlign, based on LLMs and multi-source prompt techniques, designed to fully exploit the potential of existing drugs efficiently. Leveraging LLMs, the DrugReAlign framework acquires general knowledge about targets and drugs from extensive human knowledge bases, overcoming the data availability limitations of traditional approaches. Furthermore, we collected target summaries and target-drug space interaction data from databases as multi-source prompts, substantially improving LLM performance in drug repurposing. We validated the efficiency and reliability of the proposed framework through molecular docking and DTI datasets. Significantly, our findings suggest a direct correlation between the accuracy of LLMs' target analysis and the quality of prediction outcomes. These findings signify that the proposed framework holds the promise of inaugurating a new paradigm in drug repurposing.",BMC biology,2024

39652601,"Integration of pharmacophore-based virtual screening, molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and MD simulation for targeting EGFR: A comprehensive drug discovery study using commercial databases.","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a crucial component of cellular signaling pathways, is frequently dysregulated in a range of cancers. EGFR targeting has become a viable approach in the development of anti-cancer medications. This study employs an integrated approach to drug discovery, combining multiple computational methodologies to identify potential EGFR inhibitors. The co-crystal ligand for the EGFR protein (R85) (PDB ID: 7AEI) was employed as a model for developing pharmacophore hypotheses. Nine databases underwent a ligand-based virtual screening, and 1271 hits meeting the screening criteria were chosen. EGFR protein crystal structure was obtained from the PDB database (PDB ID: 7AEI) and prepared. The hit compounds identified during virtual screening were docked to the prepared EGFR receptor to predict binding affinities by using the glide tool's standard precision mode. The top ten compounds were chosen, and their affinities of binding ranged from -7.691 to -7.338 kcal/mol. The ADMET properties of the selected compounds were predicted, and three compounds MCULE-6473175764, CSC048452634, and CSC070083626 showed better QPPCaco values compared to other identified compounds, so these were selected for further stability analysis. To confirm the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was run using the binding sites of the top three compounds against the EGFR receptor. These results suggest that the selected compounds may be lead compounds in suppressing the biological activity of EGFR, additional experimental investigation is required.",PloS one,2024
32108318,User guide for the discovery of potential drugs via protein structure prediction and ligand docking simulation.,"Due to accumulating protein structure information and advances in computational methodologies, it has now become possible to predict protein-compound interactions. In biology, the classic strategy for drug discovery has been to manually screen multiple compounds (small scale) to identify potential drug compounds. Recent strategies have utilized computational drug discovery methods that involve predicting target protein structures, identifying active sites, and finding potential inhibitor compounds at large scale. In this protocol article, we introduce an in silico drug discovery protocol. Since multi-drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria remains a challenging problem to address, UDP-N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine ligase (murC) of Acinetobacter baumannii was used as an example, which causes nosocomial infection in hospital setups and is responsible for high mortality worldwide.

Given the fact that this pandemic is still ongoing and there are currently no drugs or vaccines against this novel coronavirus available, this in silico study was conducted to identify a potential novel SARS-CoV-2-inhibitor. Two different approaches were pursued: 1) The Docking Consensus Approach (DCA) is a novel approach, which combines molecular dynamics simulations with molecular docking. 2) The Common Hits Approach (CHA) in contrast focuses on the combination of the feature information of pharmacophore modeling and the flexibility of molecular dynamics simulations. The application of both methods resulted in the identification of 10 compounds with high coronavirus inhibition potential.",Molecular informatics,2020
33759125,Negative Image-Based Rescoring: Using Cavity Information to Improve Docking Screening.,"Molecular docking produces often lackluster results in real-life virtual screening assays that aim to discover novel drug candidates or hit compounds. The problem lies in the inability of the default docking scoring to properly estimate the Gibbs free energy of binding, which impairs the recognition of the best binding poses and the separation of active ligands from inactive compounds. Negative image-based rescoring (R-NiB) provides both effective and efficient way for re-ranking the outputted flexible docking poses to improve the virtual screening yield. Importantly, R-NiB has been shown to work with multiple genuine drug targets and six popular docking algorithms using demanding benchmark test sets. The effectiveness of the R-NiB methodology relies on the shape/electrostatics similarity between the target protein's ligand-binding cavity and the docked ligand poses. In this chapter, the R-NiB method is described with practical usability in mind.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2021
34726163,The future of biomolecular simulation in the pharmaceutical industry: what we can learn from aerodynamics modelling and weather prediction. Part 1. understanding the physical and computational complexity of in silico drug design.,"The predictive power of simulation has become embedded in the infrastructure of modern economies. Computer-aided design is ubiquitous throughout industry. In aeronautical engineering, built infrastructure and materials manufacturing, simulations are routinely used to compute the performance of potential designs before construction. The ability to predict the behaviour of products is a driver of innovation by reducing the cost barrier to new designs, but also because radically novel ideas can be piloted with relatively little risk. Accurate weather forecasting is essential to guide domestic and military flight paths, and therefore the underpinning simulations are critical enough to have implications for national security. However, in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries, the application of computer simulations remains limited by the capabilities of the technology with respect to the complexity of molecular biology and human physiology. Over the last 30 years, molecular-modelling tools have gradually gained a degree of acceptance in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug discovery has begun to benefit from physics-based simulations. While such simulations have great potential for improved molecular design, much scepticism remains about their value. The motivations for such reservations in industry and areas where simulations show promise for efficiency gains in preclinical research are discussed. In this, the first of two complementary papers, the scientific and technical progress that needs to be made to improve the predictive power of biomolecular simulations, and how this might be achieved, is firstly discussed (Part 1). In Part 2, the status of computer simulations in pharma is contrasted with aerodynamics modelling and weather forecasting, and comments are made on the cultural changes needed for equivalent computational technologies to become integrated into life-science industries.","Acta crystallographica.

38902503,NADPHnet: a novel strategy to predict compounds for regulation of NADPH metabolism via network-based methods.,"Identification of compounds to modulate NADPH metabolism is crucial for understanding complex diseases and developing effective therapies. However, the complex nature of NADPH metabolism poses challenges in achieving this goal. In this study, we proposed a novel strategy named NADPHnet to predict key proteins and drug-target interactions related to NADPH metabolism via network-based methods. Different from traditional approaches only focusing on one single protein, NADPHnet could screen compounds to modulate NADPH metabolism from a comprehensive view. Specifically, NADPHnet identified key proteins involved in regulation of NADPH metabolism using network-based methods, and characterized the impact of natural products on NADPH metabolism using a combined score, NADPH-Score. NADPHnet demonstrated a broader applicability domain and improved accuracy in the external validation set. This approach was further employed along with molecular docking to identify 27 compounds from a natural product library, 6 of which exhibited concentration-dependent changes of cellular NADPH level within 100 muM, with Oxyberberine showing promising effects even at 10 muM. Mechanistic and pathological analyses of Oxyberberine suggest potential novel mechanisms to affect diabetes and cancer.

28334282,Comprehensive assessment of flexible-ligand docking algorithms: current effectiveness and challenges.,"Protein-ligand docking has been playing an important role in modern drug discovery. To model drug-target binding in real systems, a number of flexible-ligand docking algorithms with different sampling strategies and scoring methods have been subsequently developed over the past three decades, while rigid-ligand docking is still being used because of its compelling computational efficiency. Here, a comprehensive assessment has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of flexible-ligand docking versus rigid-ligand docking for three representative docking algorithms (global optimization, incremental construction and multi-conformer docking) in virtual screening and pose prediction on the Directory of Useful Decoys. It was found that overall flexible-ligand docking did not achieve a statistically significant improvement in enrichments over rigid-ligand docking in virtual screening, but all docking programs significantly improved the success rates when considering ligand flexibility in pose prediction. The worse effectiveness of flexible-ligand docking in virtual screening than in pose prediction suggests that the challenges of current docking algorithms exist in ranking more than docking, although the use of flexible-ligand docking in virtual screening was justified by its better effectiveness for more flexible ligand in virtual screening. Challenges for scoring, including internal energy, charge polarization, entropy and flexibility, were investigated and discussed. An empirical way was also proposed to consider loss of ligand conformational entropy for virtual screening.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2018
31559538,Multi-Dimensional Screening Strategy for Drug Repurposing with Statistical Framework-A New Road to Influenza Drug discovery.,"Influenza virus is known for its intermittent outbreaks affecting billions of people worldwide. Several neuraminidase inhibitors have been used in practice to overcome this situation. However, advent of new resistant mutants has limited its clinical utilization. In the recent years drug repurposing technique has attained the limelight as it is cost effective and reduces the time consumed for drug discovery. Here, we present multi-dimensional repurposing strategy that integrates the results of ligand-, energy-, receptor cavity, and shape-based pharmacophore algorithm to effectively identify novel drug candidate for influenza. The pharmacophore hypotheses were generated by utilizing the PHASE module of Schrodinger. The generated hypotheses such as AADP, AADDD, and DDRRNH, respectively, for ligand-, e-pharmacophore and receptor cavity based approach alongside shape of oseltamivir were successfully utilized to screen the DrugBank database. Subsequently, these models were evaluated for their differentiating ability using Enrichment calculation. Receiver operating curve and enrichment factors from the analysis indicate that the models possess better capability to screen actives from decoy set of molecules. Eventually, the hits retrieved from different hypotheses were subjected to molecular docking using Glide module of Schrodinger Suite. The results of different algorithms were then combined to eliminate false positive hits and to demonstrate reliable prediction performance than existing approaches. Of note, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the extent of correlation between the glide score and IC50 values. Further, the interaction profile, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics properties were analyzed for the hit compounds. The results from our analysis showed that alprostadil (DB00770) exhibits better binding affinity toward NA protein than the existing drug molecules. The biological activity of the hit was also predicted using PASS algorithm that renders the antiviral activity of the compound. Further, the results were validated using mutation analysis and molecular dynamic simulation studies. Indeed, this integrative filtering is able to exceed accuracy of other state-of-the-art methods for the drug discovery.",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,2019

31174295,A Practical Perspective: The Effect of Ligand Conformers on the Negative Image-Based Screening.,"Negative image-based (NIB) screening is a rigid molecular docking methodology that can also be employed in docking rescoring. During the NIB screening, a negative image is generated based on the target protein's ligand-binding cavity by inverting its shape and electrostatics. The resulting NIB model is a drug-like entity or pseudo-ligand that is compared directly against ligand 3D conformers, as is done with a template compound in the ligand-based screening. This cavity-based rigid docking has been demonstrated to work with genuine drug targets in both benchmark testing and drug candidate/lead discovery. Firstly, the study explores in-depth the applicability of different ligand 3D conformer generation software for acquiring the best NIB screening results using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as the example system. Secondly, the entire NIB workflow from the protein structure preparation, model build-up, and ligand conformer generation to the similarity comparison is performed for COX-2. Accordingly, hands-on instructions are provided on how to employ the NIB methodology from start to finish, both with the rigid docking and docking rescoring using noncommercial software.

Multifarious processes when aligned with one another can result in a dysregulated output which can result in cancer progression. In the current research, one such network of proteins comprising VANG1/SCRIB/NOS1AP, which is responsible for cell migration, is targeted. The proteins are modeled using in-silico approaches, and the interaction is visualized utilizing protein-protein docking. Designing drugs for the convoluted protein network can serve as a challenging task that can be overcome by fragment-based drug designing, a recent game-changer in the computational drug discovery strategy for protein interaction networks. The model is exposed to the extraction of hotspots, also known as the restrained regions for small molecular hits. The hotspot regions are subjected to a library of generated fragments, which are then recombined and rejoined to develop small molecular disruptors of the macromolecular assemblage. Rapid screening methods using pharmacokinetic tools and 2D interaction studies resulted in four molecules that could serve the purpose of a disruptor. The final validation is executed by long-range simulations of 100 ns and exploring the stability of the complex using several parameters leading to the emergence of two novel molecules VNS003 and VNS005 that could be used as the disruptors of the protein assembly VANG1/SCRIB/NOS1AP. Also, the molecules were explored as single protein targets approbated via molecular docking and 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation. This concluded VNS003 as the most suitable inhibitor module capable of acting as a disruptor of a macromolecular assembly as well as acting on individual protein chains, thus leading to the primary hindrance in the formation of the protein interaction complex.",Molecular diversity,2023
30039416,The Use of Dynamic Pharmacophore in Computer-Aided Hit Discovery: A Case Study.,"In recent years pharmacophore modeling has become increasingly popular due to the development of software solutions and improvement in algorithms that allowed researchers to focus on interactions between protein and ligands instead of technical details of the software. At the same time, progress in computer hardware made molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on regular PC hardware possible. MD simulations are usually used, within the virtual screening process, to take into account the flexibility of the target and studying it in more realistic way. In order to do so, it is customary to use simulations before the virtual screening process and then use them for collecting some specific conformation of the target used. Furthermore, some researchers have demonstrated that the use of multiple crystal structures of the same protein can be valuable to better explore the role of the ligand within the binding pocket and then evaluate the most important interactions that are created during the host-guest recognition process. Findings derived from the MD analysis, especially focused on interactions, can be in fact exploited as features for pharmacophore generation or constraints to be used in the molecular docking as integrated steps of the whole virtual screening process.

26916064,"Characterization of differences in substrate specificity among CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1: an integrated approach employing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.","Recent trends in new drug discovery of anticancer drugs have made oncologists more aware of the fact that the new drug discovery must target the developing mechanism of tumorigenesis to improve the therapeutic efficacy of antineoplastic drugs. The drugs designed are expected to have high affinity towards the novel targets selectively. Current research highlights overexpression of CYP450s, particularly cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), in tumour cells, representing a novel target for anticancer therapy. However, the CYP1 family is identified as posing significant problems in selectivity of anticancer molecules towards CYP1A1. Three members have been identified in the human CYP1 family: CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1. Although sequences of the three isoform have high sequence identity, they have distinct substrate specificities. The understanding of macromolecular features that govern substrate specificity is required to understand the interplay between the protein function and dynamics, design novel antitumour compounds that could be specifically metabolized by only CYP1A1 to mediate their antitumour activity and elucidate the reasons for differences in substrate specificity profile among the three proteins. In the present study, we employed a combination of computational methodologies: molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We utilized eight substrates for elucidating the difference in substrate specificity of the three isoforms. Lastly, we conclude that the substrate specificity of a particular substrate depends upon the type of the active site residues, the dynamic motions in the protein structure upon ligand binding and the physico-chemical characteristics of a particular ligand.

In this pursuit, the 3D QSAR ligand-pharmacophore (pharm 1) and receptor-based pharmacophore (pharm 2) search was initiated to retrieve the candidate compounds from universal natural compounds database. The validated models were allowed to map the universal natural compounds database. The obtained lead candidates were subjected to molecular docking against cysteine protease (PDB code: 1ME3) employing -Cdocker available on the discovery studio.

These Hits have demonstrated higher dock scores, displayed interactions with the key residues portraying an ideal binding mode complemented by mapping to all the features of pharm 1 and pharm 2. Additionally, they have rendered stable root mean square deviation (RMSD) and potential energy profiles illuminating their potentiality as the prospective antichagastic agents. The study further demonstrates the mechanism of inhibition by tetrad residues compromising of Gly23 and Asn70 holding the ligand at each ends and the residues Gly65 and Gly160 clamping the Hits at the center. The notable feature is that the Hits lie in close proximity with the residues Glu66 and Leu67, accommodating within the S1, S2 and S3 subsites.

This makes chemotherapy the only viable means to address the clinical manifestations and spread of this deadly disease. However, rapid surge in antimalarial resistance poses significant challenges to our efforts to eliminate Malaria since the best drug available to-date; Artemisinin and its combinations are also rapidly losing efficacy. Sodium ATPase (PfATP4) of Plasmodium has been recently explored as a suitable target for new antimalarials such as Cipargamin. Prior studies showed that multiple compounds from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) chemical libraries were efficient PfATP4 inhibitors.

27863030,Integration of Multiple Analytical and Computational Tools for the Discovery of High-Potency Enzyme Inhibitors from Herbal Medicines.,"Herbal medicines (HMs) are an important source of drugs. In this study, an efficient strategy integrating ultrafiltration LC-MS, microplate bioassays, and molecular docking was proposed to screen high-potency enzyme inhibitors from HMs. Using this strategy, the structure-activity relationships (SARs) including binding-affinity-based SAR, enzymatic-activity-based SAR, and structural-complementarity-based SAR of compounds in an HM can be analyzed to provide abundant information for drug discovery. A prominent advantage of the approach is that it offers a multidimensional perspective to understand enzyme-ligand interactions, which could help to avoid false-positive screening results brought by a single method. By using xanthine oxidase (XOD) as an illustrative case, two types of potent XOD inhibitors, including flavones and coumarins, were successfully screened out from an HM of Ginkgo biloba. The study is expected to set a solid foundation for multidisciplinary cooperation in drug discovery.",ChemMedChem,2016
29241370,Identification of structural requirements and prediction of inhibitory activity of natural flavonoids against Zika virus through molecular docking and Monte Carlo based QSAR Simulation.,"There has been growing interest in the research of flavonoids due to their potential antiviral activities. Recently, some natural flavonoids have shown potential inhibitory activity against zika virus NS3-NS2B protease. In order to accelerate the drug discovery efforts using flavonoids, a Monte Carlo simulation-based QSAR method has been applied to find out the structural requirements for the inhibitory activity. The best QSAR model was obtained using SMILES descriptors and HSG descriptors with (1)EC connectivity with the following statistical parameters: R (2) = 0.9569 and Q (2) = 0.9050 for the test set. The best model was further utilised for the prediction of inhibitory activity of some other natural flavonoids. Four flavonoids (amentoflavone, fisetin, isorhamnetin and theaflavin-3-gallate) have shown higher predicted inhibitory activity and further validated by performing docking analysis.

32899120,Targeting the Initiator Protease of the Classical Pathway of Complement Using Fragment-Based Drug Discovery.,"The initiating protease of the complement classical pathway, C1r, represents an upstream and pathway-specific intervention point for complement-related autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Yet, C1r-targeted therapeutic development is currently underrepresented relative to other complement targets. In this study, we developed a fragment-based drug discovery approach using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and molecular modeling to identify and characterize novel C1r-binding small-molecule fragments. SPR was used to screen a 2000-compound fragment library for binding to human C1r. This led to the identification of 24 compounds that bound C1r with equilibrium dissociation constants ranging between 160-1700 microM. Two fragments, termed CMP-1611 and CMP-1696, directly inhibited classical pathway-specific complement activation in a dose-dependent manner. CMP-1611 was selective for classical pathway inhibition, while CMP-1696 also blocked the lectin pathway but not the alternative pathway. Direct binding experiments mapped the CMP-1696 binding site to the serine protease domain of C1r and molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies, combined with C1r autoactivation assays, suggest that CMP-1696 binds within the C1r active site. The group of structurally distinct fragments identified here, along with the structure-activity relationship profiling of two lead fragments, form the basis for future development of novel high-affinity C1r-binding, classical pathway-specific, small-molecule complement inhibitors.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020

Increased GS activity activates notch signaling pathway which is associated with cancer stemness and drug resistance in cancer cells. A total of 69,075 natural and their derivative compounds were screened to identify the lead compound on the basis of in silico GS catalytic domain binding potential and in vitro selective anticancer efficacy. STOCK1N-23234 showed higher dock score (-11.82) compared to DAPT (-9.2) in molecular docking experiment and formed hydrogen bond with the key amino acid (Asp385) involve in catalysis process. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation parameters (RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA and hydrogen bond formation) revealed that the STOTCK1N-23234 formed structurally and energetically stable complex with the GS catalytic domain with lower binding energy (-22.79 kcal/mol) compared to DAPT (-16.22 kcal/mol). STOCK1N-23234 showed better toxicity (up to 60%) against colon and breast cancer cells (HCT-116 and MDA-MB-453) at 1-70 microM concentration. Interestingly, STOCK1N-23234 did not showed cytotoxicity against human normal breast cells (MCF-10A). STOCK1N-23234 treatment significantly decreased sphere formation, notch promoter activity, and transcription of notch target genes (Hes-1 and Hey-1) in HCT-116 cells derived colonosphere. Confocal microscopy revealed that STOTCK1N-23234 treatment at test concentration induced apoptosis related morphological changes, reduced mitochondria membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species production in HCT-116 cells compared to non-treated cells.

26481649,The statistics of virtual screening and lead optimization.,"Analytic formulae are used to estimate the error for two virtual screening metrics, enrichment factor and area under the ROC curve. These analytic error estimates are then compared to bootstrapping error estimates, and shown to have excellent agreement with respect to area under the ROC curve and good agreement with respect to enrichment factor. The major advantage of the analytic formulae is that they are trivial to calculate and depend only on the number of actives and inactives and the measured value of the metric, information commonly reported in papers. In contrast to this, the bootstrapping method requires the individual compound scores. Methods for converting the error, which is calculated as a variance, into more familiar error bars are also discussed.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2015
27179709,Machine learning optimization of cross docking accuracy.,"Performance of small molecule automated docking programs has conceptually been divided into docking -, scoring -, ranking - and screening power, which focuses on the crystal pose prediction, affinity prediction, ligand ranking and database screening capabilities of the docking program, respectively. Benchmarks show that different docking programs can excel in individual benchmarks which suggests that the scoring function employed by the programs can be optimized for a particular task. Here the scoring function of Smina is re-optimized towards enhancing the docking power using a supervised machine learning approach and a manually curated database of ligands and cross docking receptor pairs. The optimization method does not need associated binding data for the receptor-ligand examples used in the data set and works with small train sets. The re-optimization of the weights for the scoring function results in a similar docking performance with regard to docking power towards a cross docking test set. A ligand decoy based benchmark indicates a better discrimination between poses with high and low RMSD. The reported parameters for Smina are compatible with Autodock Vina and represent ready-to-use alternative parameters for researchers who aim at pose prediction rather than affinity prediction.",Computational biology and chemistry,2016

Cancer research in the last 15 years has provided unprecedented information on the role of epigenetics in cancer initiation and progression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are recognized as important epigenetic markers in cancer, whose overexpression leads to increased metastasis and angiogenesis. In the current study, thirty-four (34) compounds from Andrographis paniculata were screened for the identification of potential candidate drugs, targeting three Class I HDACs (Histone deacetylases), namely HDAC1 (PDB id 5ICN), HDAC3 (PDB id 4A69) and HDAC8 (PDB id 5FCW) through computer-assisted drug discovery study. Results showed that some of the phytochemicals chosen for this study exhibited significant drug-like properties. In silico molecular docking study further revealed that out of 34 compounds, the flavonoid Andrographidine E had the highest binding affinities towards HDAC1 (-9.261 Kcal mol(-1)) and 3 (-9.554 Kcal mol(-1)) when compared with the control drug Givinostat (-8.789 and -9.448 Kcal mol(-1)).

39475501,Introducing SpaceGA: A Search Tool to Accelerate Large Virtual Screenings of Combinatorial Libraries.,"The growth of make-on-demand libraries in recent years has provided completely new possibilities for virtual screening for discovering new hit compounds with specific and favorable properties. However, since these libraries now contain billions of compounds, screening them using traditional methods such as molecular docking has become challenging and requires substantial computational resources. Thus, to take real advantage of the new possibilities introduced by the make-on-demand libraries, different methods have been proposed to accelerate the screening process and prioritize molecules for evaluation. Here, we introduce SpaceGA, a genetic algorithm that leverages the rapid similarity search tool SpaceLight (Bellmann, L.; Penner, P.; Rarey, M. Topological similarity search in large combinatorial fragment spaces. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021, 61, 238-251). to constrain the optimization process to accessible compounds within desired combinatorial libraries.

38753096,Correlation of protein binding pocket properties with hits' chemistries used in generation of ultra-large virtual libraries.,"Although the size of virtual libraries of synthesizable compounds is growing rapidly, we are still enumerating only tiny fractions of the drug-like chemical universe. Our capability to mine these newly generated libraries also lags their growth. That is why fragment-based approaches that utilize on-demand virtual combinatorial libraries are gaining popularity in drug discovery. These a la carte libraries utilize synthetic blocks found to be effective binders in parts of target protein pockets and a variety of reliable chemistries to connect them. There is, however, no data on the potential impact of the chemistries used for making on-demand libraries on the hit rates during virtual screening. There are also no rules to guide in the selection of these synthetic methods for production of custom libraries. We have used the SAVI (Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory) library, constructed using 53 reliable reaction types (transforms), to evaluate the impact of these chemistries on docking hit rates for 40 well-characterized protein pockets. The data shows that the virtual hit rates differ significantly for different chemistries with cross coupling reactions such as Sonogashira, Suzuki-Miyaura, Hiyama and Liebeskind-Srogl coupling producing the highest hit rates. Virtual hit rates appear to depend not only on the property of the formed chemical bond but also on the diversity of available building blocks and the scope of the reaction. The data identifies reactions that deserve wider use through increasing the number of corresponding building blocks and suggests the reactions that are more effective for pockets with certain physical and hydrogen bond-forming properties.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2024

Therefore, an alternative drug discovery method is used to identify new and safer 'disease-modifying drugs'. METHODS: Herein, we screened 646 small molecules of natural origin having reported pharmacological and functional values through in-silico docking studies to predict safer neuromodulatory molecules with potential to modulate acetylcholine metabolism. Further, the potential of the predicted molecules to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and their ability to protect neurons from degeneration was determined through in-vitro assays. RESULTS: Based on in-silico AChE interaction studies, we predicted quercetin, caffeine, ascorbic acid and gallic acid to be potential AChE inhibitors. We confirmed the AChE inhibitory potential of these molecules through in-vitro AChE inhibition assay and compared results with donepezil and begacestat. Herbal molecules significantly inhibited enzyme activity and inhibition for quercetin and caffeine did not show any significant difference from donepezil. Further, the tested molecules did not show any neurotoxicity against primary (E18) hippocampal neurons. We observed that quercetin and caffeine significantly improved neuronal survival and efficiently protected hippocampal neurons from HgCl2 induced neurodegeneration, which other molecules, including donepezil and begacestat, failed to do.

By using molecular docking as a tool for the screening process and then by calculating ligand binding in an active receptor site using scoring functions and inspecting the proper orientation of pharmacophores in the binding site, the potential compounds will be chosen. After that, in order to test the potential compounds in a realistic environment, molecular dynamics simulation and related analysis have to be carried out for separating the false positives and the true positives from each other and finally identifying true ""Hit"" compounds. It's good to emphasize that if any of these identified potential compounds turn out to have the efficacy to affect that specific molecular target, it can be taken to the phase 2 clinical trials straightaway.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019

32986426,OptiMol: Optimization of Binding Affinities in Chemical Space for Drug Discovery.,"Ligand-based drug design has recently benefited from the development of deep generative models. These models enable extensive explorations of the chemical space and provide a platform for molecular optimization. However, the vast majority of current methods does not leverage the structure of the binding target, which potentiates the binding of small molecules and plays a key role in the interaction. We propose an optimization pipeline that leverages complementary structure-based and ligand-based methods. Instead of performing docking on a fixed chemical library, we iteratively select promising compounds in the full chemical space using a ligand-centered generative model. Molecular docking is then used as an oracle to guide compound optimization. This allows for iterative generation of compounds that fit the target structure better and better, without prior knowledge about bioactives. For this purpose, we introduce a new graph to Selfies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) which benefits from an 18-fold faster decoding than the graph to graph state of the art, while achieving a similar performance. We then successfully optimize the generation of molecules toward high docking scores, enabling a 10-fold enrichment of high-scoring compounds found with a fixed computational cost.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2020

Here we develop a new strategy that integrates virtual screening, affinity mass spectrometry (MS) and targeted metabolomics for efficient discovery of herb-derived ligands towards a specific protein target site. Herb-based virtual screening conveniently selects herbs of potential bioactivity whereas affinity MS combined with targeted metabolomics readily screens candidate compounds in a high-throughput manner. This new integrated approach was benchmarked on screening chemical ligands that target the hydrophobic pocket of the nucleoprotein (NP) of Ebola viruses for which no small molecule ligands have been reported. Seven compounds identified by this approach from the crude extracts of three natural herbs were all validated to bind to the NP target in pure ligand binding assays. Among them, three compounds isolated from Piper nigrum (HJ-1, HJ-4 and HJ-6) strongly promoted the formation of large NP oligomers and reduced the protein thermal stability. In addition, cooperative binding between these chemical ligands and an endogenous peptide ligand was observed, and molecular docking was employed to propose a possible mechanism.

Therefore, the construction of a PPI-focused chemical library is an inevitable necessity for future drug discovery. Natural products have been used as traditional medicines to treat human diseases for millennia; in addition, their molecular scaffolds have been used in diverse approved drugs and drug candidates. The recent discovery of the ability of natural products to inhibit PPIs led us to use natural products as a chemical library for PPI-targeted drug discovery. In this study, we collected natural products (NPDB) from non-commercial and in-house databases to analyze their similarities to small-molecule PPI inhibitors (iPPIs) and FDA-approved drugs by using eight molecular descriptors. Then, we evaluated the distribution of NPDB and iPPIs in the chemical space, represented by the molecular fingerprint and molecular scaffolds, to identify the promising scaffolds, which could interfere with PPIs. To investigate the ability of natural products to inhibit PPI targets, molecular docking was used. Then, we predicted a set of high-potency natural products by using the iPPI-likeness score based on a docking score-weighted model. These selected natural products showed high binding affinities to the PPI target, namely XIAP, which were validated in an in vitro experiment. In addition, the natural products with novel scaffolds might provide a promising starting point for further medicinal chemistry developments.

38870352,Identification of structural fingerprints among natural inhibitors of HDAC1 to accelerate nature-inspired drug discovery in cancer epigenetics.,"Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), a class I HDAC enzyme, is crucial for histone modification. Currently, it is emerged as one of the important biological targets for designing small molecule drugs through cancer epigenetics. Along with synthetic inhibitors different natural inhibitors are showing potential HDAC1 inhibitions. In order to gain insights into the relationship between the molecular structures of the natural inhibitors and HDAC1, different molecular modelling techniques (Bayesian classification, recursive partitioning, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations) have been applied on a dataset of 155 HDAC1 nature-inspired inhibitors with diverse scaffolds. The Bayesian study showed acceptable ROC values for both the training set and test sets. The Recursive partitioning study produced decision tree 1 with 6 leaves. Further, molecular docking study was processed for generating the protein ligand complex which identified some potential amino acid residues such as F205, H28, L271, P29, F150, Y204 for the binding interactions in case of natural inhibitors. Stability of these HDAC1-natutal inhibitors complexes has been also evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation study. The current modelling study is an attempt to get a deep insight into the different important structural fingerprints among different natural compounds modulating HDAC1 inhibition.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

39637455,Potential matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 inhibitors identified from Ehretia species for the treatment of chronic wounds - Computational drug discovery approaches.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) serve as prognostic factors in several pathophysiological conditions, including chronic wounds. Therefore, they are considered important therapeutic targets in the intervention and treatment of these conditions. In this study, computational tools such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were used to gain insight into protein‒ligand interactions and determine the free binding energy between Ehretia species phytoconstituents and gelatinases (MMP2 and MMP9). A total of 74 phytoconstituents from Ehretia species were compiled from the literature, and 46 of these compounds were identified as potential inhibitors of at least one type of MMP. Molecular docking revealed that lithospermic acid B, rosmarinic acid, and danshensu had stronger binding affinities against the two enzymes than the reference ligands. Furthermore, (9S, 10E, 12Z, 15Z)-9-hydroxy-10,12,15-octadecatrienoic ( *-octadecatrienoic) had a higher binding energy for MMP2, whereas caffeic anhydride and caffeic acid established stronger binding energy with MMP9 than the reference ligand. These complexes also demonstrated relatively stable, favourable, and comparable conformational changes with those of unbound proteins at 500 ns. The free energy decomposition results further provide detailed insights into the contributions of active site residues and different types of interactions to the overall binding free energy. Finally, most of the hit phytoconstituents (rosmarinic acid, caffeic anhydride, caffeic acid, and danshensu) had good physicochemical, drug-likeness, and pharmacokinetic properties. Collectively, our findings showed that phytoconstituents from Ehretia species could be beneficial in the search for novel MMP inhibitors as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic wounds.",Computers in biology and medicine,2025
30576905,NAOMInext - Synthetically feasible fragment growing in a structure-based design context.,"Since decades de novo design of small molecules is intensively used and fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) approaches still gain in popularity. Recent publications considering synthetically feasible de novo drug design underline the ongoing need for new methods. Continuous development of algorithms and tools are made, where a combination of intuitive usage, acceptable runtime, and a thoroughly evaluated workflow on large scale data sets is still a curiosity. Here, we present an intuitive approach for constrained synthetically feasible fragment growing. Starting from a fragment within its crystallized structure building blocks are attached via covalent bond formation to build up larger ligands. Iteratively, conformations are generated inside the binding site and scored to find the best suitable one. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of large flexible building blocks a novel dynamic adaptation algorithm is introduced. The technique achieves low runtimes while keeping high accuracies. The developed workflow is evaluated on a large-scale data set of 264 co-crystallized fragments with their corresponding elaborated ligands. Using our approach for fragment-based ligand growing, we were able to generate putative ligands within an RMSD of less than 2 A compared to its crystallized structure. Additionally, we were able to show the benefit of a monolithic tethered docking like methodology compared to state of the art docking. We incorporated our method, NAOMInext, in a clearly arranged graphical user interface that assists the user by defining valuable constraints to improve and accelerate the sampling workflow. In combination with predefined synthetic reaction rules NAOMInext efficiently suggests ideas for the next generation of novel lead compounds.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019

This study aims to uncover the genes and pathways involved in HCC through network pharmacology (NP) and to discover potential drugs via machine learning (ML)-based ligand screening. Additionally, toxicity prediction, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted. NP study identified key genes related to HCC, particularly the enzymes AKT1 and GSK3beta. Pathway analysis revealed that crucial pathways like PI3K-AKT and WNT signalling play pivotal roles in HCC progression.

28389892,In silico identification and validation of a novel hypothetical protein in Cryptosporidium hominis and virtual screening of inhibitors as therapeutics.,"Computational approaches to predict structure/function and other biological characteristics of proteins are becoming more common in comparison to the traditional methods in drug discovery. Cryptosporidiosis is a major zoonotic diarrheal disease particularly in children, which is caused primarily by Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum. Currently, there are no vaccines for cryptosporidiosis and recommended drugs are ineffective. With the availability of complete genome sequence of C. hominis, new targets have been recognized for the development of effective and better drugs and/or vaccines. We identified a unique hypothetical protein (TU502HP) in the C. hominis genome from the CryptoDB database. A three-dimensional model of the protein was generated using the Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement server through an iterative threading method. Functional annotation and phylogenetic study of TU502HP protein revealed similarity with human transportin 3. The model is further subjected to a virtual screening study form the ZINC database compound library using the Dock Blaster server. A docking study through AutoDock software reported N-(3-chlorobenzyl)ethane-1,2-diamine as the best inhibitor in terms of docking score and binding energy. The reliability of the binding mode of the inhibitor is confirmed by a complex molecular dynamics simulation study using GROMACS software for 10 ns in the water environment. Furthermore, antigenic determinants of the protein were determined with the help of DNASTAR software. Our findings report a great potential in order to provide insights in the development of new drug(s) or vaccine(s) for treatment and prophylaxis of cryptosporidiosis among humans and animals.",Parasitology research,2017

The thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) enzyme, crucial for maintaining the parasite's redox balance and preventing oxidative stress, has been identified as a promising target for anti-schistosomal drug development. This study aims to identify potential TGR inhibitors from Azadirachta indica phytochemicals using molecular modeling approaches. We screened 60 compounds derived from A. indica bark and leaves through molecular docking to assess their binding affinity, followed by the evaluation of binding-free energies for the most promising candidates. Drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties were assessed, and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the conformational stability of the protein-ligand complexes. Our findings revealed that several A. indica compounds exhibited significantly lower docking scores (up to -9.669 kcal/mol) compared to the standard drug praziquantel (-4.349 kcal/mol). Notably, Isorhamnetin, Isomargolonone, Nimbaflavone, Quercetin, and Nimbionol demonstrated strong interactions with TGR, although Isorhamnetin showed potential mutagenicity. Further binding free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of Isomargolonone, Nimbionol, and Quercetin as potential TGR inhibitors. In conclusion, these findings suggest that Isomargolonone, Nimbionol, and Quercetin warrant further experimental validation as promising candidates for anti-schistosomal therapy.",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,2025

Our model captures comprehensive molecular features by leveraging both the sequential character structure of SMILES and the three-dimensional spatial structure of conformers. The framework employs contrastive learning techniques, utilizing InfoNCE loss to align SMILES and conformer embeddings, along with task-specific loss functions, such as ConR for regression and SupCon for classification. To address data imbalance, we incorporate feature distribution smoothing (FDS), a common challenge in drug discovery. We evaluated the framework through multiple case studies, including SARS-CoV-2 drug docking score prediction, molecular property prediction using MoleculeNet data sets, and kinase inhibitor prediction for JAK-1, JAK-2, and MAPK-14 using custom data sets curated from PubChem. The results consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, with ConR and FDS significantly improving regression tasks and SupCon enhancing classification performance.

28361681,An integrated approach with new strategies for QSAR models and lead optimization.,"BACKGROUND: Computational drug design approaches are important for shortening the time and reducing the cost for drug discovery and development. Among these methods, molecular docking and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) play key roles for lead discovery and optimization. Here, we propose an integrated approach with core strategies to identify the protein-ligand hot spots for QSAR models and lead optimization. These core strategies are: 1) to generate both residue-based and atom-based interactions as the features; 2) to identify compound common and specific skeletons; and 3) to infer consensus features for QSAR models. RESULTS: We evaluated our methods and new strategies on building QSAR models of human acetylcholinesterase (huAChE). The leave-one-out cross validation values q (2) and r (2) of our huAChE QSAR model are 0.82 and 0.78, respectively. The experimental results show that the selected features (resides/atoms) are important for enzymatic functions and stabling the protein structure by forming key interactions (e.g., stack forces and hydrogen bonds) between huAChE and its inhibitors. Finally, we applied our methods to arthrobacter globiformis histamine oxidase (AGHO) which is correlated to heart failure and diabetic. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our AGHO QSAR model, we identified a new substrate verified by bioassay experiments for AGHO. These results show that our methods and new strategies can yield stable and high accuracy QSAR models. We believe that our methods and strategies are useful for discovering new leads and guiding lead optimization in drug discovery.",BMC genomics,2017
27450574,Structure-based virtual screening toward the discovery of novel inhibitors of the DNA repair activity of the human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1.,"The DNA repair activity of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) has been recognized as a promising target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors to be used in combination with anticancer agents. In an attempt to identify novel inhibitors of APE1, we present a structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) study based on molecular docking analysis of the compounds of NCI database using the GOLD 5.1.0 (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking) suite of programs. Compounds selected in this screening were tested with a fluorescence-based APE1 endonuclease activity assay. Two compounds (37 and 41) were able to inhibit the multifunctional enzyme APE1 in the micromolar range, while compound 22 showed inhibitory effects at nanomolar concentrations. These results were confirmed by a plasmid DNA nicking assay. In addition, the potential APE1 inhibitors did not affect the cell viability of non-tumor MCF10A cells. Overall, compounds 22, 37, and 41 appear to be important scaffolds for the design of novel APE1 inhibitors and this study highlights the relevance of in silico-based approaches as valuable tools in drug discovery.",Chemical biology & drug design,2016
34445773,Paradoxical Pro-angiogenic Effect of Low-Dose Ellipticine Identified by In Silico Drug Repurposing.,"Inadequate vessel maintenance or growth causes ischemia in diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, developing an effective strategy to salvage ischemic tissues using a novel compound is urgent. Drug repurposing has become a widely used method that can make drug discovery more efficient and less expensive. Additionally, computational virtual screening tools make drug discovery faster and more accurate. This study found a novel drug candidate for pro-angiogenesis by in silico virtual screening. Using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) microarray datasets related to angiogenesis studies, differentially expressed genes were identified and characteristic direction signatures extracted from GEO2EnrichR were used as input data on L1000CDS(2) to screen pro-angiogenic molecules. After a thorough review of the candidates, a list of compounds structurally similar to TWS-119 was generated using ChemMine Tools and its clustering toolbox. ChemMine Tools and ChemminR structural similarity search tools for small-molecule analysis and clustering were used for second screening. A molecular docking simulation was conducted using AutoDock v.4 to evaluate the physicochemical effect of secondary-screened chemicals. A cell viability or toxicity test was performed to determine the proper dose of the final candidate, ellipticine. As a result, we found ellipticine, which has pro-angiogenic effects, using virtual computational methods. The noncytotoxic concentration of ellipticine was 156.25 nM. The phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta was decreased, whereas the beta-catenin expression was increased in human endothelial cells treated with ellipticine. We concluded that ellipticine at sublethal dosage could be successfully repositioned as a pro-angiogenic substance by in silico virtual screening.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021
33333976,DockingApp RF: A State-of-the-Art Novel Scoring Function for Molecular Docking in a User-Friendly Interface to AutoDock Vina.,"MOTIVATION: Bringing a new drug to the market is expensive and time-consuming. To cut the costs and time, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches have been increasingly included in the drug discovery pipeline. However, despite traditional docking tools show a good conformational space sampling ability, they are still unable to produce accurate binding affinity predictions. This work presents a novel scoring function for molecular docking seamlessly integrated into DockingApp, a user-friendly graphical interface for AutoDock Vina. The proposed function is based on a random forest model and a selection of specific features to overcome the existing limits of Vina's original scoring mechanism. A novel version of DockingApp, named DockingApp RF, has been developed to host the proposed scoring function and to automatize the rescoring procedure of the output of AutoDock Vina, even to nonexpert users. RESULTS: By coupling intermolecular interaction, solvent accessible surface area features and Vina's energy terms, DockingApp RF's new scoring function is able to improve the binding affinity prediction of AutoDock Vina. Furthermore, comparison tests carried out on the CASF-2013 and CASF-2016 datasets demonstrate that DockingApp RF's performance is comparable to other state-of-the-art machine-learning- and deep-learning-based scoring functions. The new scoring function thus represents a significant advancement in terms of the reliability and effectiveness of docking compared to AutoDock Vina's scoring function. At the same time, the characteristics that made DockingApp appealing to a wide range of users are retained in this new version and have been complemented with additional features.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020
36153472,"A high quality, industrial data set for binding affinity prediction: performance comparison in different early drug discovery scenarios.","We release a new, high quality data set of 1162 PDE10A inhibitors with experimentally determined binding affinities together with 77 PDE10A X-ray co-crystal structures from a Roche legacy project. This data set is used to compare the performance of different 2D- and 3D-machine learning (ML) as well as empirical scoring functions for predicting binding affinities with high throughput. We simulate use cases that are relevant in the lead optimization phase of early drug discovery. ML methods perform well at interpolation, but poorly in extrapolation scenarios-which are most relevant to a real-world application. Moreover, we find that investing into the docking workflow for binding pose generation using multi-template docking is rewarded with an improved scoring performance. A combination of 2D-ML and 3D scoring using a modified piecewise linear potential shows best overall performance, combining information on the protein environment with learning from existing SAR data.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2022

Existing studies have focused on similar ligands, while the behaviors of dissimilar ligands remain unknown. In this study, we developed an intercomparison strategy in order to compare the binding modes of ligands with different molecular structures. A systematic analysis of a newly constructed protein-ligand complex structure dataset showed that ligands with similar structures tended to share a similar binding mode, which is consistent with the Molecular Similarity Principle. More importantly, the results revealed that dissimilar ligands can also bind in a similar fashion. This finding may open another avenue for drug discovery. Furthermore, a template-guiding method was introduced for predicting protein-ligand complex structures. With the use of dissimilar ligands as templates, our method significantly outperformed the traditional molecular docking methods. The newly developed template-guiding method was further applied to recent CELPP studies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021
37962849,Identification of potent inhibitors for Leishmania donovani homoserine kinase: an integrated in silico and kinetic study.,"Leishmaniasis is caused by  approximately 20 species of Leishmania that affects millions in endemic areas. Available therapies are not sufficient to effectively control the disease, cause severe side effects and eventually lead to drug resistance, making the discovery of novel therapeutic molecules an immediate need. Molecular target-based drug discovery, where the target is a defined molecular gene, protein or a mechanism, is a rationale driven approach for novel therapeutics. Humans obtain the essential amino acid such as threonine from dietary sources, while Leishmania synthesize it de-novo. Enzymes of the threonine biosynthesis pathway, including the rate limiting Homoserine kinase (HSK) which converts L-homoserine into ortho-phospho homoserine are thus attractive targets for rationale driven therapy. The absence of HSK in humans and its presence in Leishmania donovani enhances the opportunity to exploit HSK as a molecular target for anti-leishmanials therapeutic development. In this study, we utilize structure-based high throughput drug discovery (SBDD), followed by biochemical validation and identified two potential inhibitors (RH00038 and S02587) from Maybridge chemical library that targets L. donovani HSK. These two inhibitors effectively induced the mortality of Leishmania donovani in both amastigote and promastigote stages, with one of them being specific to parasite and twice as effective as the standard therapeutic molecule.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2024

This condition is the second most widespread malignancy in elderly males and one of the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening conditions. The Androgen receptor signaling pathway played a crucial role in the initiation and spread to increase the risk of PCa. Hence, targeting the AR receptor signaling pathway is a key strategy for a therapeutic plan for PCa. Our study focuses on recognizing potential inhibitors for dual targeting in PCa by using the in-silico approach. In this study, we target the two enzymes that are CYP17A1 (3RUK) and 5alpha-reductase (3G1R) responsible for PCa, with the help of phytoconstituents. The natural plant contains various phytochemical types produced from secondary metabolites and used as a medical treatment. The in-silico investigation of phytoconstituents and enzymes was done by approaching molecular docking, ADMET analysis, and high-level molecular dynamic simulation used to assess the stability and binding affinities of the protein-ligand complex. Some phytoconstituents, such as Peonidin, Pelargonidin, Malvidin and Berberine show complex has good molecular interaction with protein. The reliability of the docking scores was examined using a molecular dynamic simulation, which revealed that the complex remained stable throughout the simulation, which ranged from 0 to 200 ns. The selected hits may be effective against CYP17A1 (3RUK) and 5alpha-reductase (3G1R) (PCa) using a computer-aided drug design (CADD) method, which further enables researchers for upcoming in-vivo and in-vitro research, according to our in-silico approach.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32768649,Discovery of a d-pro-lys peptidomimetic inhibitor of MMP9: Addressing the gelatinase selectivity beyond S1' subsite.,"Despite a high degree of structural similarity, it is known that MMP2 and MMP9 have distinct roles in the angiogenic switch and in cell migration, as they activate diverse signaling pathways. Indeed, inhibition of MMP2 and MMP9 can show beneficial or detrimental effects depending on the stage of tumor progression. Thus, the selective inhibition of gelatinases is of relevance for a successful drug lead, which has to be achieved despite the high structural similarity of the two gelatinases. Herein, the synthesis and evaluation of d-proline-derived hydroxamic acids containing amino appendages at C-4 as gelatinase inhibitors are reported. Inhibition assays enabled the identification of a > 200-fold selective MMP9 inhibitor when Lys was considered as a C-4 substituent, thus addressing gelatinase selectivity beyond the S1' subsite, which is a major driver for selectivity.

28526744,Combining properties of different classes of PI3Kalpha inhibitors to understand the molecular features that confer selectivity.,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are major regulators of many cellular functions, and hyperactivation of PI3K cell signalling pathways is a major target for anticancer drug discovery. PI3Kalpha is the isoform most implicated in cancer, and our aim is to selectively inhibit this isoform, which may be more beneficial than concurrent inhibition of all Class I PI3Ks. We have used structure-guided design to merge high-selectivity and high-affinity characteristics found in existing compounds. Molecular docking, including the prediction of water-mediated interactions, was used to model interactions between the ligands and the PI3Kalpha affinity pocket. Inhibition was tested using lipid kinase assays, and active compounds were tested for effects on PI3K cell signalling. The first-generation compounds synthesized had IC(50) (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values >4 muM for PI3Kalpha yet were selective for PI3Kalpha over the other Class I isoforms (beta, delta and gamma). The second-generation compounds explored were predicted to better engage the affinity pocket through direct and water-mediated interactions with the enzyme, and the IC(50) values decreased by  approximately 30-fold. Cell signalling analysis showed that some of the new PI3Kalpha inhibitors were more active in the H1047R mutant bearing cell lines SK-OV-3 and T47D, compared with the E545K mutant harbouring MCF-7 cell line. In conclusion, we have used a structure-based design approach to combine features from two different compound classes to create new PI3Kalpha-selective inhibitors. This provides new insights into the contribution of different chemical units and interactions with different parts of the active site to the selectivity and potency of PI3Kalpha inhibitors.",The Biochemical journal,2017
27438815,An NMR-Guided Screening Method for Selective Fragment Docking and Synthesis of a Warhead Inhibitor.,"Selective hits for the glutaredoxin ortholog of Brucella melitensis are determined using STD NMR and verified by trNOE and (15)N-HSQC titration. The most promising hit, RK207, was docked into the target molecule using a scoring function to compare simulated poses to experimental data. After elucidating possible poses, the hit was further optimized into the lead compound by extension with an electrophilic acrylamide warhead. We believe that focusing on selectivity in this early stage of drug discovery will limit cross-reactivity that might occur with the human ortholog as the lead compound is optimized. Kinetics studies revealed that lead compound 5 modified with an ester group results in higher reactivity than an acrylamide control; however, after modification this compound shows little selectivity for bacterial protein versus the human ortholog. In contrast, hydrolysis of compound 5 to the acid form results in a decrease in the activity of the compound. Together these results suggest that more optimization is warranted for this simple chemical scaffold, and opens the door for discovery of drugs targeted against glutaredoxin proteins-a heretofore untapped reservoir for antibiotic agents.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2016
33831016,Development of a graph convolutional neural network model for efficient prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities.,"Prediction of protein-ligand interactions is a critical step during the initial phase of drug discovery. We propose a novel deep-learning-based prediction model based on a graph convolutional neural network, named GraphBAR, for protein-ligand binding affinity. Graph convolutional neural networks reduce the computational time and resources that are normally required by the traditional convolutional neural network models. In this technique, the structure of a protein-ligand complex is represented as a graph of multiple adjacency matrices whose entries are affected by distances, and a feature matrix that describes the molecular properties of the atoms. We evaluated the predictive power of GraphBAR for protein-ligand binding affinities by using PDBbind datasets and proved the efficiency of the graph convolution. Given the computational efficiency of graph convolutional neural networks, we also performed data augmentation to improve the model performance. We found that data augmentation with docking simulation data could improve the prediction accuracy although the improvement seems not to be significant. The high prediction performance and speed of GraphBAR suggest that such networks can serve as valuable tools in drug discovery.",PloS one,2021

35011387,In Vitro Evaluation of the Anti-Diabetic Potential of Aqueous Acetone Helichrysum petiolare Extract (AAHPE) with Molecular Docking Relevance in Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic condition that can lead to significant complications and a high fatality rate worldwide. Efforts are ramping up to find and develop novel alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitors that are both effective and potentially safe. Traditional methodologies are being replaced with new techniques that are less complicated and less time demanding; yet, both the experimental and computational strategies are viable and complementary in drug discovery and development. As a result, this study was conducted to investigate the in vitro anti-diabetic potential of aqueous acetone Helichrysum petiolare and B.L Burtt extract (AAHPE) using a 2-NBDG, 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake assay. In addition, we performed molecular docking of the flavonoid constituents identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) from AAHPE with the potential to serve as effective and safe alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, which are important in drug discovery and development. The results showed that AAHPE is a potential inhibitor of both alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, with IC(50) values of 46.50 +/- 6.17 (microg/mL) and 37.81 +/- 5.15 (microg/mL), respectively. This is demonstrated by a significant increase in the glucose uptake activity percentage in a concentration-dependent manner compared to the control, with the highest AAHPE concentration of 75 microg/mL of glucose uptake activity being higher than metformin, a standard anti-diabetic drug, in the insulin-resistant HepG2 cell line. The molecular docking results displayed that the constituents strongly bind alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase while achieving better binding affinities that ranged from DeltaG = -7.2 to -9.6 kcal/mol (compared with acarbose DeltaG = -6.1 kcal/mol) for alpha-amylase, and DeltaG = -7.3 to -9.0 kcal/mol (compared with acarbose DeltaG = -6.3 kcal/mol) for alpha-glucosidase.

Particularly, compound 8y showed the excellent dual acetylcholinesterase-butyrylcholinesterase inhibition activity, superior to rivastigmine, a dual cholinesterase inhibitor drug. Furthermore, the compounds displayed a competitive anti-acetylcholinesterase mechanism with the substrate and low cytotoxicity. Molecular docking showed that the isoquinoline moiety is embedded in a cavity surrounded by four aromatic residues of acetylcholinesterase by the pi-pi action. Structure-activity relationship showed that the p-substituents on the C-ring can dramatically improve the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, while 8-OMe can increase the activity against the two cholinesterases simultaneously. Thus, the title compounds emerged as promising lead compounds for the development of novel cholinesterase inhibitor agents.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2020

To this end, we describe structural binding-site insights for facilitating COVID-19 drug design when targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), a common conserved component of RNA viruses. We combined an RDRP structure data set, including 384 RDRP PDB structures and all corresponding RDRP-ligand interaction fingerprints, thereby revealing the structural characteristics of the active sites for application to RDRP-targeted drug discovery. Specifically, we revealed the intrinsic ligand-binding modes and associated RDRP structural characteristics. Four types of binding modes with corresponding binding pockets were determined, suggesting two major subpockets available for drug discovery. We screened a drug data set of 7894 compounds against these binding pockets and presented the top-10 small molecules as a starting point in further exploring the prevention of virus replication. In summary, the binding characteristics determined here help rationalize RDRP-targeted drug discovery and provide insights into the specific binding mechanisms important for containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",Journal of proteome research,2020

In the current scenario, COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory syndromes, hence it is envisaged from our study that these traditional medicines are very likely to provide a favourable effect on COVID-19 infections. The active ingredients identified from these natural products are previously reported for antiviral activities against large group of viruses. Totally 47 bioactives identified from the medicinal plants were investigated against the structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro and spike protein) and human ACE2 receptor. The top leads were identified based on interaction energies, number of hydrogen bond and other parameters that explain their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive ligands such as Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine targeted the hotspot residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In fact, this protease enzyme has an essential role in mediating the viral replication and therefore compounds targeting this key enzyme are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. The top scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation. Besides, the stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Overall, the study emphasized that the proposed hit Cucurbitacin E and orientin could serve as a promising scaffold for developing anti-COVID-19 drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

29111708,Group Additivity in Ligand Binding Affinity: An Alternative Approach to Ligand Efficiency.,"Group additivity is a concept that has been successfully applied to a variety of thermochemical and kinetic properties. This includes drug discovery, where functional group additivity is often assumed in ligand binding. Ligand efficiency can be recast as a special case of group additivity where DeltaG/HA is the group equivalent (HA is the number of non-hydrogen atoms in a ligand). Analysis of a large data set of protein-ligand binding affinities (K(i)) for diverse targets shows that in general ligand binding is distinctly nonlinear. It is possible to create a group equivalent scheme for ligand binding, but only in the context of closely related proteins, at least with regard to size. This finding has broad implications for drug design from both experimental and computational points of view. It also offers a path forward for a more general scheme to assess the efficiency of ligand binding.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2017

Inflammation or injury to the cranial nerves that regulate the facial muscles is primarily responsible for that disease. Commiphora wightii remains recognized as a cure for a few human ailments. This study focused on therapeutic phenomena of C. wightii for the treatment of Bell's palsy, utilizing the network drug discovery and molecular docking techniques. Active biological constituents of C. wightii were retrieved from literature and independent databases. Potential therapeutic targets (431) of 13 bioactive phytochemicals were fetched via SwissTargetPrediction tool. Putative intersecting targets (855) of Bell's palsy were computed through the DisGeNET and GeneCards datasets. Subsequently, by the analysis of potential shared targets (87) of C. wightii and Bell's palsy, a Venn diagram was drawn. DAVID database was used to evaluate gene functional annotations and enriched pathways that are involved in Bell's palsy. STRING database was used for generating the protein-protein relationship complex. Visual presentations of the interactions of potential targets to active chemical constituents were done by the Cytoscape. Whereas, the conformational research sorted out 10 key targets through the protein-protein interactions network. Moreover, the capacity of therapeutic ingredients to interact with a target inhibiting Bell's palsy was confirmed by molecular docking, which might ratify the findings of network pharmacology. In the molecular complex of AKT1-cholesterol, a 100-ns simulation unveiled a graceful stability, with a minimal 0.167 A ligand shift and resilient hydrogen bonds (ASN54 and SER205). The final 20 ns showcased a P1 motif pirouette, gracefully forming aromatic bonds with H165 and W186, underscoring the complex's dynamic finesse. This study evaluated compound-target interactions and their impact on disease-related genes. It revealed that five genes (AKT1, TNF, MAPK3, EGFR and SRC) of C. wightii might be useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of Bell's palsy, as well as helping in lowering down the blood pressure.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
39690486,Residue-Level Multiview Deep Learning for ATP Binding Site Prediction and Applications in Kinase Inhibitors.,"Accurate identification of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding sites is crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug discovery, particularly in targeting kinases for cancer treatment. Existing methods face significant challenges due to their reliance on time-consuming precomputed features and the heavily imbalanced nature of binding site data without further investigations on their utility in drug discovery. To address these limitations, we introduced Multiview-ATPBind and ResiBoost. Multiview-ATPBind is an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates one-dimensional (1D) sequence and three-dimensional (3D) structural information for rapid and precise residue-level pocket-ligand interaction predictions. Additionally, ResiBoost is a novel residue-level boosting algorithm designed to mitigate data imbalance by enhancing the prediction of rare positive binding residues. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmark data sets, showing significant improvements in balanced metrics with both experimental and AI-predicted structures.

31165955,Identification of novel and potent small-molecule inhibitors of tubulin with antitumor activities by virtual screening and biological evaluations.,"Microtubules (made up of alpha and beta-tubulin subunits) play an essential role in the process of mitosis and cell proliferation, thus making them an ideal target for anticancer drugs discovery. Microtubule-targeted drugs, including taxanes and vinca alkaloids, can suppress microtubule dynamics, cause mitotic block and apoptosis, which have been widely used in the treatment of various cancers. There are three unique binding sites (taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and colchicine) in tubulin can be targeted to develop tubulin inhibitors. In this study, we selected the colchicine binding site in tubulin as our target. By performing molecular docking-based virtual screening combined with in vitro tubulin polymerization inhibition assay, we identified two novel and potent tubulin inhibitors (9 and 19). These two compounds arrested cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis at sub muM concentrations. In addition, they displayed potent antiproliferative activity with IC(50) values in the nM range. Finally, the probable binding modes of 9 and 19 were probed by molecular docking. These two compounds with novel scaffold will shed new light on the lead molecules discovery and the design of new microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs).",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2019
37528665,Structure-based virtual screening approach reveals natural multi-target compounds for the development of antimalarial drugs to combat drug resistance.,"Compared to the previous year, there has been an increase of nearly 2 million malaria cases in 2021. The emergence of drug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria parasite, has led to a decline in the effectiveness of existing antimalarial drugs. To address this problem, the present study aimed to identify natural compounds with the potential to inhibit multiple validated antimalarial drug targets. The natural compounds from the Natural Product Activity and Species Source (NPASS) database were screened against ten validated drug targets of Plasmodium falciparum using a structure-based molecular docking method. Twenty compounds, with targets ranging from three to five, were determined as the top hits. The molecular dynamics simulations of the top six complexes (NPC246162 in complex with PfAdSS, PfGDH, and PfNMT; NPC271270 in complex with PfCK, PfGDH, and PfdUTPase) confirmed their stable binding affinity in the dynamic environment. The Tanimoto coefficient and distance matrix score analysis show the structural divergence of all the hit compounds from known antimalarials, indicating minimum chances of cross-resistance. Thus, we propose further investigating these compounds in biochemical and parasite inhibition studies to reveal the real therapeutic potential. If found successful, these compounds may be a new avenue for future drug discovery efforts to combat existing antimalarial drug resistance.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Structure-based VS (SBVS) exploits knowledge about the three-dimensional (3D) structure of protein targets and uses the docking methodology as search engine for novel hits. The success of a SBVS campaign strongly depends upon the accuracy of the docking protocol used to select the candidates from large chemical libraries. The identification of suitable protocols is therefore a crucial step in the setup of SBVS experiments.

Targeting ErbB4 presents a viable strategy to address this challenge. This study employs a comprehensive approach combining structure-based pharmacophore modelling, molecular docking, and MM-GBSA calculations to identify novel ErbB4 kinase inhibitors. Critical pharmacophoric features were extracted from the crystal structures of ErbB4-lapatinib, followed by virtual screening of the Chembl database to discover potential small molecule candidates.

27881238,Rational identification of natural organic compounds to target the intermolecular interaction between Foxm and DNA in colorectal cancer.,"The oncogenic transcription factor forkhead box M (Foxm) is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting the protein interaction with its cognate DNA has been established as an attractive approach to anti-CRC chemotherapy. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the Foxm adopts considerably different conformations to interact with and without its DNA partner; the holo conformation is tightly packed as a typical globulin configuration, whereas the apo form is locally unstructured that exhibits intrinsic disorder in DNA recognition helix, indicating that DNA binding can help the Foxm refolding. With this finding, the MD equilibrium structure of DNA-free Foxm was utilized to perform molecular docking virtual screening against a natural organic compound library. Consequently, six hit compounds were identified as potential small-molecule mediators of Foxm-DNA interaction; their binding affinities (K(D)) to Foxm DNA-binding domain were then determined to range between 3.8 and 230muM by using isothermal titration calorimetry. These compounds were suggested to recognize and stabilize the apo conformation of Foxm, thus shifting the binding reaction equilibrium of Foxm from DNA-bound to DNA-free states to disrupt the formation of Foxm-DNA adduct.",Bioorganic chemistry,2017

Multiple analysis of crystal structures reveals the presence of W1, W2, and W3 water locations in the active site pocket of Mpro; W1 and W2 are unstable and are weakly bonded with protein in comparison to W3 of Mpro-native. So, we adopt the water displacement method to occupy W1 or W2 sites by triggering HCQ or its analogs to inactivate the enzyme. Virtual screening is employed to find out best analogs of HCQ, molecular docking is used for water displacement from catalytic region of Mpro, and finally, MD simulations are conducted for validation of these findings. The docking study reveals that W1 and W2 are occupied by respective atoms of ZINC28706440 whereas W2 by HCQ and indacaterol. Finally, MD results demonstrate (i) HCQ occupies W1 and W2 positions, but its analogs (indacaterol and ZINC28706440) are inadequate to retain either W1 or W2 (ii) His41 and Asp187 are stabilized by W3 in Mpro-native and His41, Cys145 and HCQ by W7 in ZINC28706440, and W4, W5, and W6 make water mediated bridge between indacaterol with His41. The structural, dynamical, and thermodynamic (WFP and J value) profiling parameters suggest that W3, W4, and W7 are prominent in their corresponding positions in comparison with W5 and W6. The final results conclude that ZINC28706440 may act as a best analog of HCQ with acceptable physico-chemical and toxicological scores and may further be synthesized for experimental validation.",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2021

Numerous approaches exist to predict potential targets for a given ligand, but true targets may be inconsistently ranked. More advanced simulation methods may provide benefit in such cases by reranking these initial predictions. We evaluated the ability of binding pose metadynamics to improve the predicted rankings for three diverse ligands and their six true targets. Initial predictions using pharmacophore mapping showed no true targets ranked in the top 50 and two targets each ranked within the 50-100, 100-150, and 250-300 ranges respectively. Following binding pose metadynamics, ranking of true targets improved for four out of the six targets and included the highest ranked predictions overall, while rankings deteriorated for two targets. The revised rankings predicted two true targets ranked within the top 50, and one target each within the 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, and 200-250 ranges respectively.

Recently, deep learning-based methods have made significant advancements in blind protein-ligand docking, but their protein features are suboptimal because they do not fully consider the difference between potential pocket regions and non-pocket regions in protein feature extraction. In this work, we propose a pocket-guided strategy for guiding the ligand to dock to potential docking regions on a protein. To this end, we design a plug-and-play module to enhance the protein features, which can be directly incorporated into existing deep learning-based blind docking methods. The proposed module first estimates potential pocket regions on the target protein and then leverages a pocket-guided attention mechanism to enhance the protein features.

Non-Structural Proteins are the central components of coronaviral transcription and replication machinery in SARS-CoV-2 and also stimulate mRNA cap methylation to avoid the immune response. Non-Structural Protein 16 (NSP16) is one of the primary targets for the drug discovery of coronaviruses. Discovering an effective inhibitor against the NSP16 in comparison with Sinefungin was the main purpose of this investigation. Binding free-energy calculations, computational methods of molecular dynamics, docking, and virtual screening were utilized in this study. The ZINC and PubChem databases were applied to screen some chemical compounds regarding Sinefungin as a control inhibitor. Based on structural similarity to Sinefungin, 355 structures were obtained from the mentioned databases. Subsequently, this set of compounds were monitored by AutoDock Vina software, and ultimately the potent inhibitor (PUBCHEM512713) was chosen. At the next stage, molecular dynamics were carried out by GROMACS software to evaluate the potential elected compounds in a simulated environment and in a timescale of 100 nanoseconds. MM-PBSA investigation exhibited that the value of binding free energy for PUBCHEM512713 (-30.829 kJ.mol(-1)) is more potent than Sinefungin (-11.941 kJ.mol(-1)). Furthermore, the results of ADME analysis illustrated that the pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and lipophilicity parameters of PUBCHEM512713 are admissible for human utilization.

Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD) methods and Machine Learning (ML) have become more effective over the last two decades for drug and materials discovery and optimization. They are now fast, flexible, and sufficiently accurate to accelerate the discovery of new molecules and materials. Radiopharmaceuticals have also started to benefit from rapid developments in computational methods. Here, we review the types of computational molecular design techniques that have been used for radiopharmaceuticals design. We also provide a thorough examination of success stories in the design of radiopharmaceuticals, and the strengths and weaknesses of the computational methods. We begin by providing a brief overview of therapeutic and diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals and the steps involved in radiopharmaceuticals design and development. We then review the computational design methods used in radiopharmaceutical studies, including molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, molecular docking, pharmacophore modelling, and datadriven ML. Finally, the difficulties and opportunities presented by radiopharmaceutical modelling are highlighted. The review emphasizes the potential of computational design methods to accelerate the production of these very useful clinical radiopharmaceutical agents and aims to raise awareness among radiopharmaceutical researchers about computational modelling and simulation methods that can be of benefit to this field.",Current radiopharmaceuticals,2022
38999982,G Protein-Coupled Receptor-Ligand Pose and Functional Class Prediction.,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) transmembrane protein family members play essential roles in physiology. Numerous pharmaceuticals target GPCRs, and many drug discovery programs utilize virtual screening (VS) against GPCR targets. Improvements in the accuracy of predicting new molecules that bind to and either activate or inhibit GPCR function would accelerate such drug discovery programs. This work addresses two significant research questions. First, do ligand interaction fingerprints provide a substantial advantage over automated methods of binding site selection for classical docking? Second, can the functional status of prospective screening candidates be predicted from ligand interaction fingerprints using a random forest classifier? Ligand interaction fingerprints were found to offer modest advantages in sampling accurate poses, but no substantial advantage in the final set of top-ranked poses after scoring, and, thus, were not used in the generation of the ligand-receptor complexes used to train and test the random forest classifier. A binary classifier which treated agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists as active and all other ligands as inactive proved highly effective in ligand function prediction in an external test set of GPR31 and TAAR2 candidate ligands with a hit rate of 82.6% actual actives within the set of predicted actives.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024
39125808,Developing a Semi-Supervised Approach Using a PU-Learning-Based Data Augmentation Strategy for Multitarget Drug Discovery.,"Multifactorial diseases demand therapeutics that can modulate multiple targets for enhanced safety and efficacy, yet the clinical approval of multitarget drugs remains rare. The integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in drug discovery has revolutionized virtual screening. This study investigates the synergy between ML/DL methodologies, molecular representations, and data augmentation strategies. Notably, we found that SVM can match or even surpass the performance of state-of-the-art DL methods. However, conventional data augmentation often involves a trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate. To address this, we introduce Negative-Augmented PU-bagging (NAPU-bagging) SVM, a novel semi-supervised learning framework. By leveraging ensemble SVM classifiers trained on resampled bags containing positive, negative, and unlabeled data, our approach is capable of managing false positive rates while maintaining high recall rates. We applied this method to the identification of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs), where high recall rates are critical for compiling a list of interaction candidate compounds. Case studies demonstrate that NAPU-bagging SVM can identify structurally novel MTDL hits for ALK-EGFR with favorable docking scores and binding modes, as well as pan-agonists for dopamine receptors. The NAPU-bagging SVM methodology should serve as a promising avenue to virtual screening, especially for the discovery of MTDLs.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024
26270398,A combined cheminformatic and bioinformatic approach to address the proteolytic stability challenge in peptide-based drug discovery.,"We have created models to predict cleavage sites for several human proteases including caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cathepsin G, cathepsin K, cathepsin L, elastase-2, granzyme A, granzyme B, matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP2), MMP7, MMP9, thrombin, and trypsin-1. Rather than representing the sequence pattern around the potential cleavage site through a series of flags with each flag representing one of the 20 standard amino acids, we first represent each amino acid by its calculated properties. For these calculated properties, we use validated cheminformatic descriptors, such as molecular weight, logP, and polar surface area, of the individual amino acids. Finally, the cleavage site-specific descriptors are calculated through various combinations of the individual amino acid descriptors for the residues surrounding the cleavage site. Some of these combinations do not take into account the location of the residue, as long as it is in a prescribed neighborhood of the potential cleavage site, whereas others are sensitive to the precise order of the residues in the sequence. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows one to perform meaningful calculations with nonstandard amino acids for which little or no data exists. Finally, using both docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the potential for and limitations of protease crystal structures to impact the design of proteolytically stable peptides.",Biopolymers,2015
38731447,Ensemble-Based Virtual Screening Led to the Discovery of Novel Lead Molecules as Potential NMBAs.,"Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are routinely used during anesthesia to relax skeletal muscle. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels; NMBAs can induce muscle paralysis by preventing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from binding to nAChRs situated on the postsynaptic membranes. Despite widespread efforts, it is still a great challenge to find new NMBAs since the introduction of cisatracurium in 1995. In this work, an effective ensemble-based virtual screening method, including molecular property filters, 3D pharmacophore model, and molecular docking, was applied to discover potential NMBAs from the ZINC15 database. The results showed that screened hit compounds had better docking scores than the reference compound d-tubocurarine. In order to further investigate the binding modes between the hit compounds and nAChRs at simulated physiological conditions, the molecular dynamics simulation was performed. Deep analysis of the simulation results revealed that ZINC257459695 can stably bind to nAChRs' active sites and interact with the key residue Asp165. The binding free energies were also calculated for the obtained hits using the MM/GBSA method. In silico ADMET calculations were performed to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of hit compounds in the human body. Overall, the identified ZINC257459695 may be a promising lead compound for developing new NMBAs as an adjunct to general anesthesia, necessitating further investigations.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2024
27584594,Automatically updating predictive modeling workflows support decision-making in drug design.,"Using predictive models for early decision-making in drug discovery has become standard practice. We suggest that model building needs to be automated with minimum input and low technical maintenance requirements. Models perform best when tailored to answering specific compound optimization related questions. If qualitative answers are required, 2-bin classification models are preferred. Integrating predictive modeling results with structural information stimulates better decision making. For in silico models supporting rapid structure-activity relationship cycles the performance deteriorates within weeks. Frequent automated updates of predictive models ensure best predictions. Consensus between multiple modeling approaches increases the prediction confidence. Combining qualified and nonqualified data optimally uses all available information.

38334277,A discovery of potent kaempferol derivatives as multi-target medicines against diabetes as well as bacterial infections: an in silico approach.,"Flavonoids demonstrate beneficial effects on human health because flavonoids contain important biological properties. Kaempferol is a flavonol, type of flavonoid found in eatable plants and in plants usually employed in ancient drugs (Moringa oleifera, Tilia spp., fern genus spp. and gingko etc.). Some medicinal studies have shown that the use of foods full of kaempferol decreases the risk of many (cancer, vascular) diseases. All the data of 50 kaempferol derivatives were collected from PubChem database. Through Schrodinger software, 3D-QSAR study was performed for 50 compounds by using method of field base. Conformer of kaempferol derivatives was docked against anti-diabetic, anti-microbial co-crystal structures and protein. To monitor the best anti-diabetic and antibacterial agent, particular kaempferol derivatives were downloaded from PubChem database. Virtual screening by molecular docking provided four lead compounds with four different proteins. These hit compounds were found to be potent inhibitor for diabetic enzymes alpha-amylase and DPP IV and had the potential to suppress DNA gyrase and dihydrofolate reductase synthesis. Molecular dynamic simulation of docked complexes evaluates the value of root mean square fluctuation by iMOD server. Kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-(2, 3-di-Z-p-coumaroyl) rhamnoside (42) compound used as anti-diabetic and kaempferol 3-O-gentiobioside (3) as antibacterial with good results can be used for drug discovery.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
39692527,EvaluationMaster: A GUI Tool for Structure-Based Virtual Screening Evaluation Analysis and Decision-Making Support.,"Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) plays an indispensable role in the early phases of drug discovery, utilizing computational docking techniques to predict interactions between molecules and biological targets. During the SBVS process, selecting appropriate target structures and screening algorithms is crucial, as these choices significantly shape the outcomes. Typically, such selections require researchers to be proficient with multiple algorithms and familiar with evaluation and analysis processes, complicating their tasks. These algorithms' lack of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) further complicates it. To address these challenges, we introduced EvaluationMaster, the first GUI tool designed specifically to streamline and standardize the evaluation and decision-making processes in SBVS. It supports four docking algorithms' evaluation under multiple target structures and offers a comprehensive platform that manages the entire workflow horizontal line including the downloading of molecules, construction of decoy datasets, prediction of protein pockets, batch docking, and extensive data analysis. By automating complex evaluation tasks and providing clear visualizations of analysis results, EvaluationMaster significantly reduces the learning curve for researchers and boosts the efficiency of evaluations, potentially improving SBVS hit rates and accelerating the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2025
37861428,In silico computational drug discovery: a Monte Carlo approach for developing a novel JAK3 inhibitors.,"Inhibition of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), a member of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, remains an essential area of research for developing treatments for autoimmune diseases, particularly cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The recent discovery of a new JAK3 protein, PDB ID: 4Z16, offers exciting possibilities for developing inhibitors capable of forming a covalent bond with the Cys909 residue, thereby contributing to JAK3 inhibition. A powerful prediction model was constructed and validated using Monte Carlo methods, employing various internal and external techniques. This approach resulted in the prediction of eleven new molecules, which were subsequently filtered to identify six compounds exhibiting potent pIC(50) values. These candidates were then subjected to ADMET analysis, molecular docking (including reversible-reversible docking with tofacitinib, an FDA-approved drug, and reversible-irreversible docking for the newly designed compounds), molecular dynamics (MD) analysis for 300 ns, and calculation of free binding energy. The results suggested that these compounds hold promise as JAK3 inhibitors. In summary, the new compounds have exhibited favorable outcomes compared to other compounds across various modeling approaches. The collective findings from these investigations provide valuable insights into the potential therapeutic applications of covalent JAK3 inhibitors, offering a promising direction for the development of novel treatments for autoimmune disorders.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

38810646,Structure-based discovery of CFTR potentiators and inhibitors.,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a crucial ion channel whose loss of function leads to cystic fibrosis, whereas its hyperactivation leads to secretory diarrhea. Small molecules that improve CFTR folding (correctors) or function (potentiators) are clinically available. However, the only potentiator, ivacaftor, has suboptimal pharmacokinetics and inhibitors have yet to be clinically developed. Here, we combine molecular docking, electrophysiology, cryo-EM, and medicinal chemistry to identify CFTR modulators. We docked  approximately 155 million molecules into the potentiator site on CFTR, synthesized 53 test ligands, and used structure-based optimization to identify candidate modulators. This approach uncovered mid-nanomolar potentiators, as well as inhibitors, that bind to the same allosteric site. These molecules represent potential leads for the development of more effective drugs for cystic fibrosis and secretory diarrhea, demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale docking for ion channel drug discovery.",Cell,2024
29190087,Task-Specific Scoring Functions for Predicting Ligand Binding Poses and Affinity and for Screening Enrichment.,"Molecular docking, scoring, and virtual screening play an increasingly important role in computer-aided drug discovery. Scoring functions (SFs) are typically employed to predict the binding conformation (docking task), binding affinity (scoring task), and binary activity level (screening task) of ligands against a critical protein target in a disease's pathway. In most molecular docking software packages available today, a generic binding affinity-based (BA-based) SF is invoked for all three tasks to solve three different, but related, prediction problems. The limited predictive accuracies of such SFs in these three tasks has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we develop BT-Score, an ensemble machine-learning (ML) SF of boosted decision trees and thousands of predictive descriptors to estimate BA. BT-Score reproduced BA of out-of-sample test complexes with correlation of 0.825. Even with this high accuracy in the scoring task, we demonstrate that the docking and screening performance of BT-Score and other BA-based SFs is far from ideal. This has motivated us to build two task-specific ML SFs for the docking and screening problems. We propose BT-Dock, a boosted-tree ensemble model trained on a large number of native and computer-generated ligand conformations and optimized to predict binding poses explicitly. This model has shown an average improvement of 25% over its BA-based counterparts in different ligand pose prediction scenarios. Similar improvement has also been obtained by our screening-based SF, BT-Screen, which directly models the ligand activity labeling task as a classification problem. BT-Screen is trained on thousands of active and inactive protein-ligand complexes to optimize it for finding real actives from databases of ligands not seen in its training set. In addition to the three task-specific SFs, we propose a novel multi-task deep neural network (MT-Net) that is trained on data from the three tasks to simultaneously predict binding poses, affinities, and activity levels. We show that the performance of MT-Net is superior to conventional SFs and on a par with or better than models based on single-task neural networks.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2018
35972903,Induced-Fit Docking Enables Accurate Free Energy Perturbation Calculations in Homology Models.,"Homology models have been used for virtual screening and to understand the binding mode of a known active compound; however, rarely have the models been shown to be of sufficient accuracy, comparable to crystal structures, to support free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We demonstrate here that the use of an advanced induced-fit docking methodology reliably enables predictive FEP calculations on congeneric series across homology models >/=30% sequence identity. Furthermore, we show that retrospective FEP calculations on a congeneric series of drug-like ligands are sufficient to discriminate between predicted binding modes. Results are presented for a total of 29 homology models for 14 protein targets, showing FEP results comparable to those obtained using experimentally determined crystal structures for 86% of homology models with template structure sequence identities ranging from 30 to 50%. Implications for the use and validation of homology models in drug discovery projects are discussed.",Journal of chemical theory and computation,2022

Targeting PI3K is emerging as a promising strategy in the treatment of these blood cancers. Recent approval of idelalisib, a specific inhibitor of PI3Kdelta, for the treatment of several types of HM, is likely to attract more interest in search for novel PI3K inhibitors. Here, we discuss classic and cutting-edge techniques and strategies to identify PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of HM.

38582610,DockingGA: enhancing targeted molecule generation using transformer neural network and genetic algorithm with docking simulation.,"Generative molecular models generate novel molecules with desired properties by searching chemical space. Traditional combinatorial optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, have demonstrated superior performance in various molecular optimization tasks. However, these methods do not utilize docking simulation to inform the design process, and heavy dependence on the quality and quantity of available data, as well as require additional structural optimization to become candidate drugs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model named DockingGA that combines Transformer neural networks and genetic algorithms to generate molecules with better binding affinity for specific targets. In order to generate high quality molecules, we chose the Self-referencing Chemical Structure Strings to represent the molecule and optimize the binding affinity of the molecules to different targets. Compared to other baseline models, DockingGA proves to be the optimal model in all docking results for the top 1, 10 and 100 molecules, while maintaining 100% novelty. Furthermore, the distribution of physicochemical properties demonstrates the ability of DockingGA to generate molecules with favorable and appropriate properties. This innovation creates new opportunities for the application of generative models in practical drug discovery.",Briefings in functional genomics,2024

During the past decade, a variety of techniques and algorithms have been proposed and tested with different purposes in the scope of SBVS. Although SBVS has been a common and proven technology, it still shows some challenges and problems that are needed to be addressed, where the negative influence regardless of protein flexibility and the inaccurate prediction of binding affinity are the two major challenges.

38084877,Computational exploration of Zika virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors: a promising antiviral drug discovery approach.,"The emergence of the Zika virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, became a significant worldwide health issue due to its link with severe neurological complications. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the Zika virus plays a significant part in the replication of the virus and is considered a promising candidate for antiviral drug identification. In this study, we employed computer-based drug discovery approaches to identify potential natural compounds that could act as inhibitors against the RdRp protein of the Zika virus. A comprehensive virtual screening strategy was implemented using the MTiOpenScreen webserver to identify natural compounds from the NP-Lib database. Four natural compounds having the ZINC ID - ZINC000253499147, ZINC000299817665, ZINC000044404209, and ZINC000253388535 were selected based on the binding score revealed during virtual screening. Molecular docking simulations of these selected compounds and reference compounds were performed to assess the binding affinities and the molecular bonds formed during the docking. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, endpoint free binding energy calculation and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to evaluate the stability and dynamics of the protein-ligand complexes. These compounds exhibited favourable binding energies and formed stable interactions within the active site of the RdRp protein. Moreover, the molecular dynamics simulations revealed the robustness of the protein-ligand complexes, suggesting the potential for sustained inhibition. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of novel therapeutic interventions against Zika virus infection. Further experimental validation and optimization of the identified compounds are warranted to advance their potential translation into effective antiviral drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Orphan GPCRs are GPCR proteins for which endogenous ligands have not yet been identified and they present interesting avenues for therapeutic intervention. This study focuses on GPR78, an orphan GPCR that is expressed in the central nervous system and linked to neurological disorders. GPR78 has no reported crystal structure and there is limited research. In this study, we have predicted the three dimensional model of GPR78 and its probable binding pocket.

34500568,Recent Advances in In Silico Target Fishing.,"In silico target fishing, whose aim is to identify possible protein targets for a query molecule, is an emerging approach used in drug discovery due its wide variety of applications. This strategy allows the clarification of mechanism of action and biological activities of compounds whose target is still unknown. Moreover, target fishing can be employed for the identification of off targets of drug candidates, thus recognizing and preventing their possible adverse effects. For these reasons, target fishing has increasingly become a key approach for polypharmacology, drug repurposing, and the identification of new drug targets. While experimental target fishing can be lengthy and difficult to implement, due to the plethora of interactions that may occur for a single small-molecule with different protein targets, an in silico approach can be quicker, less expensive, more efficient for specific protein structures, and thus easier to employ. Moreover, the possibility to use it in combination with docking and virtual screening studies, as well as the increasing number of web-based tools that have been recently developed, make target fishing a more appealing method for drug discovery. It is especially worth underlining the increasing implementation of machine learning in this field, both as a main target fishing approach and as a further development of already applied strategies. This review reports on the main in silico target fishing strategies, belonging to both ligand-based and receptor-based approaches, developed and applied in the last years, with a particular attention to the different web tools freely accessible by the scientific community for performing target fishing studies.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
35744940,"Going Retro, Going Viral: Experiences and Lessons in Drug Discovery from COVID-19.","The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pace of its global spread have motivated researchers to opt for repurposing existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 rather than discover or develop novel ones. For reasons of speed, throughput, and cost-effectiveness, virtual screening campaigns, relying heavily on in silico docking, have dominated published reports. A particular focus as a drug target has been the principal active site (i.e., RNA synthesis) of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), despite the existence of a second, and also indispensable, active site in the same enzyme. Here we report the results of our experimental interrogation of several small-molecule inhibitors, including natural products proposed to be effective by in silico studies. Notably, we find that two antibiotics in clinical use, fidaxomicin and rifabutin, inhibit RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in vitro and inhibit viral replication in cell culture. However, our mutagenesis studies contradict the binding sites predicted computationally. We discuss the implications of these and other findings for computational studies predicting the binding of ligands to large and flexible protein complexes and therefore for drug discovery or repurposing efforts utilizing such studies.

In pharmaceuticals, this process is used to save the time and cost for the drug discovery process with reduced risk of failure. In the present studies, repurposing of a natural molecule: sabinene (major phytochemical in cardamom) was used to characterize the new biological activities using in silico as well as in vitro approaches. In silico similarity searching demonstrated that (+)-3-carene possessed the maximum structural similarity with sabinene. In vitro activities of (+)-3-carene were repurposed for sabinene based on similarity hypothesis (similar structures may have similar biological activities). In vitro studies demonstrated that sabinene is having antimicrobial activity and also showed concentration-dependent antioxidant activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay. Sabinene treatment protected the yeast cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Moreover, it was found that sabinene treatment decreased the generation of oxidative stress and also decreased the activities of antioxidant enzymes; glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and lipid peroxidase as compared with untreated yeast cells. Sabinene was also found to have angiostatic and antiangiogenic effects. These results were supported by molecular docking studies against antiangiogenic targets. Therefore, the results of these studies suggested that structurally similar molecules are having the same activity.

30798436,Combining ligand- and structure-based in silico methods for the identification of natural product-based inhibitors of Akt1.,"The traditional method of drug discovery process has been surpassed by a rational approach where computer-aided drug designing plays a vital role in the identification of leads from large compound databases. Further, natural products have an important role in drug discovery as these have been the source of most active ingredients of medicines. Herein, in silico structure- and ligand-based approaches have been applied to screen in-house IIIM natural product repository for Akt1 (serine/threonine protein kinases) which is a well-known therapeutic target for cancer due to its overexpression and preventing the cells from undergoing apoptosis. Combined ligand-based and structure-based strategies were applied on to the existing library comprising of about 700 pure natural products, and the compounds identified from screening were biologically evaluated for Akt1 inhibition using Akt1 kinase activity assay. Fourteen promising compounds showed significant inhibition at 500 nM through in vitro screening, and from them, eight were new for Akt1 inhibition. Through the MD studies of Akt1 with the most active compound IN00145, it was inferred that Lys179, Glu191, Glu228, Ala230, Glu234 and Asp292 are the important amino acid residues which provide stability to the Akt1-IN00145 complex. Lead optimization studies were also performed around the actives to design better and selective inhibitors for Akt1. The results emphasized the successful application of virtual screening to identify new Akt1 inhibitor scaffolds that can be developed into a drug candidate in drug discovery programme.",Molecular diversity,2020
39623285,Kinase-Bench: Comprehensive Benchmarking Tools and Guidance for Achieving Selectivity in Kinase Drug Discovery.,"Developing selective kinase inhibitors remains a formidable challenge in drug discovery because of the highly conserved structural information on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding sites across the kinase family. Tailoring docking protocols to identify promising kinase inhibitor candidates for optimization has long been a substantial obstacle to drug discovery. Therefore, we introduced ""Kinase-Bench,"" a pioneering benchmark suite designed for an advanced virtual screen, to improve the selectivity and efficacy of kinase inhibitors. Our comprehensive data set includes 6875 selective ligands and 422,799 decoys for 75 kinases, using extensive bioactivity and structural data from the ChEMBL database and decoys generated by the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced version. Our benchmarking sets and retrospective case studies were designed to provide useful guidance in discovering selective kinase inhibitors. We employed a Glide High-Throughput Virtual Screen and Standard Precision complemented by three scoring functions and customized protein-ligand interaction filters that target specific kinase residue interactions. These innovations were successfully implemented in our virtual screen efforts targeting JAK1 inhibitors, achieving selectivity against its family member, TYK2. Consequently, we identified novel potential hits: Compound 2 (JAK1 IC(50): 980.5 nM, TYK2 IC(50): 4.5 muM) and the approved pan-AKT inhibitor Capivasertib (JAK1 IC(50): 275.9 nM, TYK2 IC(50): 10.9 muM). Using the Kinase-Bench protocol, both compounds demonstrated substantial JAK1 selectivity, making them strong candidates for further investigation. Our pharmaceutical results underscore the utility of tailored virtual screen protocols in identifying selective kinase inhibitors with substantial implications for rational drug design. Kinase-Bench offers a robust toolset for selective kinase drug discovery with the potential to effectively guide future therapeutic strategies effectively.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024

38521505,"Discovery of a potent inhibitor, D-132, targeting AsfvPolX, via protein-DNA complex-guided pharmacophore screening and in vitro molecular characterizations.","The heightened transmissibility and capacity of African swine fever virus (ASFV) induce fatal diseases in domestic pigs and wild boars, posing significant economic repercussions and global threats. Despite extensive research efforts, the development of potent vaccines or treatments for ASFV remains a persistent challenge. Recently, inhibiting the AsfvPolX, a key DNA repair enzyme, emerges as a feasible strategy to disrupt viral replication and control ASFV infections. In this study, a comprehensive approach involving pharmacophore-based inhibitor screening, coupled with biochemical and biophysical analyses, were implemented to identify, characterize, and validate potential inhibitors targeting AsfvPolX. The constructed pharmacophore model, Phar-PolX-S, demonstrated efficacy in identifying a potent inhibitor, D-132 (IC(50) = 2.8 +/- 0.2 microM), disrupting the formation of the AsfvPolX-DNA complex. Notably, D-132 exhibited strong binding to AsfvPolX (KD = 6.9 +/- 2.2 microM) through a slow-on-fast-off binding mechanism. Employing molecular modeling, it was elucidated that D-132 predominantly binds in-between the palm and finger domains of AsfvPolX, with crucial residues (R42, N48, Q98, E100, F102, and F116) identified as hotspots for structure-based inhibitor optimization. Distinctively characterized by a 1,2,5,6-tetrathiocane with modifications at the 3 and 8 positions involving ethanesulfonates, D-132 holds considerable promise as a lead compound for the development of innovative agents to combat ASFV infections.",Virus research,2024
29268770,Structure based drug discovery for designing leads for the non-toxic metabolic targets in multi drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"BACKGROUND: The problem of drug resistance and bacterial persistence in tuberculosis is a cause of global alarm. Although, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 has targeted a Tb free world, the treatment gap exists and only a few new drug candidates are in the pipeline. In spite of large information from medicinal chemistry to 'omics' data, there has been a little effort from pharmaceutical companies to generate pipelines for the development of novel drug candidates against the multi drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS: In the present study, we describe an integrated methodology; utilizing systems level information to optimize ligand selection to lower the failure rates at the pre-clinical and clinical levels. In the present study, metabolic targets (Rv2763c, Rv3247c, Rv1094, Rv3607c, Rv3048c, Rv2965c, Rv2361c, Rv0865, Rv0321, Rv0098, Rv0390, Rv3588c, Rv2244, Rv2465c and Rv2607) in M. tuberculosis, identified using our previous Systems Biology and data-intensive genome level analysis, have been used to design potential lead molecules, which are likely to be non-toxic. Various in silico drug discovery tools have been utilized to generate small molecular leads for each of the 15 targets with available crystal structures. RESULTS: The present study resulted in identification of 20 novel lead molecules including 4 FDA approved drugs (droxidropa, tetroxoprim, domperidone and nemonapride) which can be further taken for drug repurposing. This comprehensive integrated methodology, with both experimental and in silico approaches, has the potential to not only tackle the MDR form of Mtb but also the most important persister population of the bacterium, with a potential to reduce the failures in the Tb drug discovery. CONCLUSION: We propose an integrated approach of systems and structural biology for identifying targets that address the high attrition rate issue in lead identification and drug development We expect that this system level analysis will be applicable for identification of drug candidates to other pathogenic organisms as well.",Journal of translational medicine,2017

CDK4 is one of the most validated therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, the discovery of potent inhibitors of CDK4 is a promising candidate in the drug discovery field. Firstly, the reference drug Palbociclib was identified from the available literature as a potential candidate against target CDK4. In the present study, the Collection of Open Natural Products (COCONUT) database was accessed for determining potential CDK4 inhibitors using computational approaches based on the Tanimoto algorithm for similarity with the target drug, i.e., Palbociclib. The potential candidates were analyzed using SWISSADME, and the best candidates were filtered based on Lipinski's Rule of 5, Brenk, blood-brain barrier permeability, and Pains parameter.

29157600,Receptor structure-based discovery of non-metabolite agonists for the succinate receptor GPR91.,"OBJECTIVE: Besides functioning as an intracellular metabolite, succinate acts as a stress-induced extracellular signal through activation of GPR91 (SUCNR1) for which we lack suitable pharmacological tools. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we first determined that the cis conformation of the succinate backbone is preferred and that certain backbone modifications are allowed for GPR91 activation. Through receptor modeling over the X-ray structure of the closely related P2Y1 receptor, we discovered that the binding pocket is partly occupied by a segment of an extracellular loop and that succinate therefore binds in a very different mode than generally believed. Importantly, an empty side-pocket is identified next to the succinate binding site. All this information formed the basis for a substructure-based search query, which, combined with molecular docking, was used in virtual screening of the ZINC database to pick two serial mini-libraries of a total of only 245 compounds from which sub-micromolar, selective GPR91 agonists of unique structures were identified. The best compounds were backbone-modified succinate analogs in which an amide-linked hydrophobic moiety docked into the side-pocket next to succinate as shown by both loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis. These compounds displayed GPR91-dependent activity in altering cytokine expression in human M2 macrophages similar to succinate, and importantly were devoid of any effect on the major intracellular target, succinate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: These novel, synthetic non-metabolite GPR91 agonists will be valuable both as pharmacological tools to delineate the GPR91-mediated functions of succinate and as leads for the development of GPR91-targeted drugs to potentially treat low grade metabolic inflammation and diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy.",Molecular metabolism,2017

However, despite a massive number of highly potent molecules being reported and several under clinical trials, no p38alpha inhibitor has been approved yet. There is still demand to discover novel p38alpha to deal with the safety issue induced by off-target effects. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we performed a machine learning-based virtual screening to identify p38alpha inhibitors from a natural products library, expecting to find novel drug lead scaffolds.

Then, six classifiers were constructed by combing two sets of molecular features with three different machine learning algorithms. After model evaluation, the three best classifiers were used for virtual screening. RESULTS: Among the 15 compounds selected for experimental validation, picrasidine S was identified as a p38alpha inhibitor with the IC(50) as 34.14 muM. Molecular docking was performed to predict the interaction mode of picrasidine S and p38alpha, indicating a specific hydrogen bond with Met109. CONCLUSION: This work provides a protocol and example for machine learning-assisted discovery of p38alpha inhibitor from natural products, as well as a novel lead scaffold represented by picrasidine S for further optimization and investigation.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2023
39431333,Advancing Anticancer Drug Discovery: Leveraging Metabolomics and Machine Learning for Mode of Action Prediction by Pattern Recognition.,"A bottleneck in the development of new anti-cancer drugs is the recognition of their mode of action (MoA). Metabolomics combined with machine learning allowed to predict MoAs of novel anti-proliferative drug candidates, focusing on human prostate cancer cells (PC-3). As proof of concept, 38 drugs are studied with known effects on 16 key processes of cancer metabolism, profiling low molecular weight intermediates of the central carbon and cellular energy metabolism (CCEM) by LC-MS/MS. These metabolic patterns unveiled distinct MoAs, enabling accurate MoA predictions for novel agents by machine learning. The transferability of MoA predictions based on PC-3 cell treatments is validated with two other cancer cell models, i.e., breast cancer and Ewing's sarcoma, and show that correct MoA predictions for alternative cancer cells are possible, but still at some expense of prediction quality. Furthermore, metabolic profiles of treated cells yield insights into intracellular processes, exemplified for drugs inducing different types of mitochondrial dysfunction. Specifically, it is predicted that pentacyclic triterpenes inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and affect phospholipid biosynthesis, as confirmed by respiration parameters, lipidomics, and molecular docking. Using biochemical insights from individual drug treatments, this approach offers new opportunities, including the optimization of combinatorial drug applications.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024

A comparative model of pfPI4KB was first constructed and validated using molecular docking techniques. Performance of Autodock4.2 and Vina4 software in predicting the inhibitor-PI4KB binding mode and energy was assessed based on two Test Sets: Test Set I contained five ligands with resolved crystal structures with PI4KB, while Test Set II considered eleven compounds with known IC50 value towards PI4KB. The outperformance of Autodock as compared to Vina was reported, giving a correlation coefficient (R(2)) value of 0.87 and 0.90 for Test Set I and Test Set II, respectively. Pharmacophore-based screening was then conducted to identify drug-like molecules from ZINC database with physicochemical similarity to two potent pfPI4KB inhibitors -namely cpa and cpb. For each query inhibitor, the best 1000 hits in terms of TanimotoCombo scores were selected and subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Binding energy was then estimated using molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach over 50 ns MD simulations of the inhibitor-pfPI4KB complexes. According to the calculated MM-GBSA binding energies, ZINC78988474 and ZINC20564116 were identified as potent pfPI4KB inhibitors with binding energies better than those of cpa and cpb, with DeltaG(binding) >/= -34.56 kcal/mol.

38760437,Identification of DprE1 inhibitors for tuberculosis through integrated in-silico approaches.,"Decaprenylphosphoryl-beta-D-ribose-2'-epimerase (DprE1), a crucial enzyme in the process of arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis, has become the target of choice for anti-TB drug discovery in the recent past. The current study aims to find the potential DprE1 inhibitors through in-silico approaches. Here, we built the pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR model using the reported 40 azaindole derivatives of DprE1 inhibitors. The best pharmacophore hypothesis (ADRRR_1) was employed for the virtual screening of the chEMBL database. To identify prospective hits, molecules with good phase scores (> 2.000) were further evaluated by molecular docking studies for their ability to bind to the DprE1 enzyme (PDB: 4KW5). Based on their binding affinities (< - 9.0 kcal/mole), the best hits were subjected to the calculation of free-binding energies (Prime/MM-GBSA), pharmacokinetic, and druglikeness evaluations. The top 10 hits retrieved from these results were selected to predict their inhibitory activities via the developed 3D-QSAR model with a regression coefficient (R(2)) value of 0.9608 and predictive coefficient (Q(2)) value of 0.7313. The induced fit docking (IFD) studies and in-silico prediction of anti-TB sensitivity for these top 10 hits were also implemented. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were performed for the top 5 hit molecules for 200 ns to check the stability of the hits with DprE1. Based on their conformational stability throughout the 200 ns simulation, hit 2 (chEMBL_SDF:357100) was identified as the best hit against DprE1 with an accepted safety profile. The MD results were also in accordance with the docking score, MM-GBSA value, and 3D-QSAR predicted activity. The hit 2 molecule, (N-(3-((2-(((1r,4r)-4-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl)amino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-6-yl)amino)phenyl)acrylamide) could serve as a lead for the discovery of a novel DprE1 inhibiting anti-TB drug.",Scientific reports,2024

35041430,Divide and Conquer. Pocket-Opening Mixed-Solvent Simulations in the Perspective of Docking Virtual Screening Applications for Drug Discovery.,"The existence of a druggable binding pocket is a prerequisite for computational drug-target interaction studies including virtual screening. Retrospective studies have shown that extended sampling methods like Markov State Modeling and mixed-solvent simulations can identify cryptic pockets relevant for drug discovery. Here, we apply a combination of mixed-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) and time-structure independent component analysis (TICA) to four retrospective case studies: NPC2, the CECR2 bromodomain, TEM-1, and MCL-1. We compare previous experimental and computational findings to our results. It is shown that the successful identification of cryptic pockets depends on the system and the cosolvent probes. We used alternative TICA internal features such as the unbiased backbone coordinates or backbone dihedrals versus biased interatomic distances. We found that in the case of NPC2, TEM-1, and MCL-1, the use of unbiased features is able to identify cryptic pockets, although in the case of the CECR2 bromodomain, more specific features are required to properly capture a pocket opening. In the perspective of virtual screening applications, it is shown how docking studies with the parent ligands depend critically on the conformational state of the targets.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022

27893735,Computational Discovery of Putative Leads for Drug Repositioning through Drug-Target Interaction Prediction.,"De novo experimental drug discovery is an expensive and time-consuming task. It requires the identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) towards targets of biological interest, either to inhibit or enhance a specific molecular function. Dedicated computational models for protein simulation and DTI prediction are crucial for speed and to reduce the costs associated with DTI identification. In this paper we present a computational pipeline that enables the discovery of putative leads for drug repositioning that can be applied to any microbial proteome, as long as the interactome of interest is at least partially known. Network metrics calculated for the interactome of the bacterial organism of interest were used to identify putative drug-targets. Then, a random forest classification model for DTI prediction was constructed using known DTI data from publicly available databases, resulting in an area under the ROC curve of 0.91 for classification of out-of-sampling data. A drug-target network was created by combining 3,081 unique ligands and the expected ten best drug targets. This network was used to predict new DTIs and to calculate the probability of the positive class, allowing the scoring of the predicted instances. Molecular docking experiments were performed on the best scoring DTI pairs and the results were compared with those of the same ligands with their original targets. The results obtained suggest that the proposed pipeline can be used in the identification of new leads for drug repositioning. The proposed classification model is available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/software/dtipred/.",PLoS computational biology,2016

25758752,"Insight into the key interactions of bromodomain inhibitors based on molecular docking, interaction fingerprinting, molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculation.","The bromodomain is a key protein-protein interaction module that specifically reads the acetylation marks of histones in epigenetic regulation. Currently, lots of inhibitors targeting the bromodomain have been reported as therapeutic agents. To better understand the interaction mechanism of bromodomain inhibitors, 20 diverse bromodomain inhibitors were studied using a combination of computational methods, including molecular docking, interaction fingerprinting, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculation. As a result, interactions important for the activity were critically analyzed, and the energy contribution in terms of individual residues was explored. These integrated results provided insights into two hot spots in the active site of the bromodomain, where the hydrophobic hot spot formed by Trp81, Val87, Leu92 and Ile146 played a central role in the interaction, and the hydrogen-bond hot spot mediated by Asn140 exhibited a moderate contribution to the binding affinity of the bromodomain inhibitors. This interaction mechanism study may facilitate the rational design of novel small-molecule bromodomain inhibitors.",Molecular bioSystems,2015
32948119,"In silico drug discovery of IKK-beta inhibitors from 2-amino-3-cyano-4-alkyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl) pyridine derivatives based on QSAR, docking, molecular dynamics and drug-likeness evaluation studies.","The Inhibitor of IKK-beta (nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta), a specific modulator of NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), is considered a valid target to discover new active compounds for various cancers and rheumatoid arthritis treatment. In this study a series of thirty 2-amino-3-cyano-4-alkyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl) pyridine derivatives was involved for a quantitative structure activity relationship model (QSAR) elaboration which allows the prediction of the pIC50 values of new designed compounds. The model can be used to predict the activity of new compounds within its applicability domain. Then a molecular docking study was carried out to identify the interactions between the compounds and the amino acids of the active site. After that, golden triangle, Veber's rule, and Lipinski's rule properties were calculated to identify the drug-likeness properties of the investigated compounds. Finally, in-silico-toxicity studies were performed to predict the toxicity of the new designed compounds. The analysis of the results of QSAR model and molecular docking succeeded to screen 21 interesting compounds with better inhibitory concentration having a good affinity to IKK-beta. All compounds were within the range set by Veber's rule and Lipinski's rule. the analysis of golden triangle showed that the thirty 2-amino-3-cyano-4-alkyl-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl) pyridine derivatives would not have clearance and cell membrane permeability problems except comp6 comp12,comp20, comp21, and comp26.As for the new designed compounds, their properties may have these problems, except two compounds which are: A8m, A8p. The A1m, A1p, A3p and A11m compounds were predicted to be nontoxic. These findings indicate that the novel potent candidate drugs have promising potential to IKK-beta enzyme inhibition and should motivate future experimental investigations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

35887220,Ligand-Enhanced Negative Images Optimized for Docking Rescoring.,"Despite the pivotal role of molecular docking in modern drug discovery, the default docking scoring functions often fail to recognize active ligands in virtual screening campaigns. Negative image-based rescoring improves docking enrichment by comparing the shape/electrostatic potential (ESP) of the flexible docking poses against the target protein's inverted cavity volume. By optimizing these negative image-based (NIB) models using a greedy search, the docking rescoring yield can be improved massively and consistently. Here, a fundamental modification is implemented to this shape-focused pharmacophore modelling approach-actual ligand 3D coordinates are incorporated into the NIB models for the optimization. This hybrid approach, labelled as ligand-enhanced brute-force negative image-based optimization (LBR-NiB), takes the best from both worlds, i.e., the all-roundedness of the NIB models and the difficult to emulate atomic arrangements of actual protein-bound small-molecule ligands. Thorough benchmarking, focused on proinflammatory targets, shows that the LBR-NiB routinely improves the docking enrichment over prior iterations of the R-NiB methodology. This boost can be massive, if the added ligand information provides truly essential binding information that was lacking or completely missing from the cavity-based NIB model. On a practical level, the results indicate that the LBR-NiB typically works well when the added ligand 3D data originates from a high-quality source, such as X-ray crystallography, and, yet, the NIB model compositions can also sometimes be improved by fusing into them, for example, with flexibly docked solvent molecules. In short, the study demonstrates that the protein-bound ligands can be used to improve the shape/ESP features of the negative images for effective docking rescoring use in virtual screening.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022

36401553,Open Binding Pose Metadynamics: An Effective Approach for the Ranking of Protein-Ligand Binding Poses.,"Predicting the correct pose of a ligand binding to a protein and its associated binding affinity is of great importance in computer-aided drug discovery. A number of approaches have been developed to these ends, ranging from the widely used fast molecular docking to the computationally expensive enhanced sampling molecular simulations. In this context, methods such as coarse-grained metadynamics and binding pose metadynamics (BPMD) use simulations with metadynamics biasing to probe the binding affinity without trying to fully converge the binding free energy landscape in order to decrease the computational cost. In BPMD, the metadynamics bias perturbs the ligand away from the initial pose. The resistance of the ligand to this bias is used to calculate a stability score. The method has been shown to be useful in reranking predicted binding poses from docking. Here, we present OpenBPMD, an open-source Python reimplementation and reinterpretation of BPMD. OpenBPMD is powered by the OpenMM simulation engine and uses a revised scoring function. The algorithm was validated by testing it on a wide range of targets and showing that it matches or exceeds the performance of the original BPMD. We also investigated the role of accurate water positioning on the performance of the algorithm and showed how the combination with a grand-canonical Monte Carlo algorithm improves the accuracy of the predictions.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022

BACKGROUND: Recently, with the progress of computing technology, it has been possible to obtain higher efficiency and lower costs for drug discovery. With in silico research and drug design, there is a reduction in time-consuming and expensive experimental work. An NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase enzyme, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), is involved in a variety of human disorders such as type II diabetes, cancer, obesity, and aging. Activation of SIRT1 could be useful for longevity and treating metabolic disorders. OBJECTIVE: We used computational methods to develop new SIRT1 activator compounds.

We used approximately 150.000 commercially available compounds from the Zinc database, which include FDA-approved drugs. According to virtual screening results, we selected seven potent activators. Then we compared these hit compounds with known activators by using docking methods. One of these hit compounds, acebutolol, is an FDA-approved drug, and was selected for additional studies using molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: Seven hit compounds were identified with database screening. Each showed strong interactions with SIRT1, and acebutolol formed H-bonds with the important active site residues, Asn226 and/or Glu230 during the dynamics simulation. CONCLUSION: Based on our in silico studies, the seven most promising compounds, especially acebutolol, showed promising SIRT1 activator potency.

SARS-CoV2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in December 2019. The COVID19 pandemic has now gripped the entire world with more than 70 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths so far. There no treatment option for COVID19 is in term of a drug or vaccine is currently available. Therefore drug repurposing may only provide a quick method for utilizing existing drugs for a therapeutic option. The virus genome contains several non-structural proteins (NSP) which serve as target for designing of antiviral agents. NSP9 of SARS-CoV2 encodes for a replicase enzyme which is essential for the virus replication in the host cell. In search of potent inhibitors, we have screened FDA approved drugs against NSP9 using in silico methods. Five drugs fluspirilene, troglitazone, alvesco, dihydroergotoxine and avodart were found to have highest affinities with the replicase. The molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies demonstrated strong drugs binding and stable NSP9-drugs complexes formation. The findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond analysis of the complexes. Principal component analysis showed the stable conformation of NSP9 upon drug binding. It could be inferred that these five drugs individually or in combinations may be used as potential inhibitors of NSP9 of SARS-CoV-2 after exploring their in vivo antiviral potential.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

32656619,Flexi-pharma: a molecule-ranking strategy for virtual screening using pharmacophores from ligand-free conformational ensembles.,"Computer-aided strategies are useful for reducing the costs and increasing the success-rate in drug discovery. Among these strategies, methods based on pharmacophores (an ensemble of electronic and steric features representing the target active site) are efficient to implement over large compound libraries. However, traditional pharmacophore-based methods require knowledge of active compounds or ligand-receptor structures, and only few ones account for target flexibility. Here, we developed a pharmacophore-based virtual screening protocol, Flexi-pharma, that overcomes these limitations. The protocol uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore receptor flexibility, and performs a pharmacophore-based virtual screening over a set of MD conformations without requiring prior knowledge about known ligands or ligand-receptor structures for building the pharmacophores. The results from the different receptor conformations are combined using a ""voting"" approach, where a vote is given to each molecule that matches at least one pharmacophore from each MD conformation. Contrarily to other approaches that reduce the pharmacophore ensemble to some representative models and score according to the matching models or molecule conformers, the Flexi-pharma approach takes directly into account the receptor flexibility by scoring in regards to the receptor conformations. We tested the method over twenty systems, finding an enrichment of the dataset for 19 of them. Flexi-pharma is computationally efficient allowing for the screening of thousands of compounds in minutes on a single CPU core. Moreover, the ranking of molecules by vote is a general strategy that can be applied with any pharmacophore-filtering program.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2020

To address this important need and help scientists overcome barriers that impede them from leveraging CADD in their drug discovery work, we have developed ezCADD, a web-based CADD modeling environment that manifests four simple design concepts: easy, quick, user-friendly, and 2D/3D visualization-enabled. In this paper, we describe the features of three fundamental applications that have been implemented in ezCADD: small-molecule docking, protein-protein docking, and binding pocket detection, and their applications in drug design against a pathogenic microbial enzyme as an example. To assess user experience and the effectiveness of our implementation, we introduced ezCADD to first-year pharmacy students as an active learning exercise in the Principles of Drug Action course.

Targeting the PPIs formed between RPA and other DNA Damage Response (DDR) mediators has become an intriguing area of research for cancer drug discovery. A number of studies applied different methods ranging from high throughput screening approaches to fragment-based drug design tools to discover RPA inhibitors. Although these methods are robust, virtual screening approaches may be allocated as an alternative to such experimental methods, especially for screening of large libraries. Here we report the comprehensive screening of the large database, ZINC15 composed of  approximately 750 M compounds and the comparison of the identified ligands with the previously known inhibitors by means of binding affinity and drug-likeness. Initially, a ligand library sharing similarity with a promising inhibitor of the N-terminal domain of the RPA70 subunit (RPA70N) was generated by screening of the ZINC15 library. 46,999 ligands were collected and screened by LeDock which produced a satisfactory correlation with the experimental values (R(2) = 0.77). 10 of the top-scoring ligands in LeDock were directly progressed to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, while 10 additional ligands were also selected based on their LeDock scores and the presence of a functional group that could interact with the key amino acids in the RPA70N cleft. MD simulations were used to predict the binding free energy of the ligands by the MM-PBSA method which produced a high level of agreement with the experiments (R(2) = 0.85). Binding free energy predictions pointed out 2 ligands with higher binding affinity than any of the reference inhibitors. Particularly the ligand ZINC000753854163 exhibited superior drug-likeness features than any of the known inhibitors.

One method is ligand-based exploration of the pharmacophoric space of inhibitors of any particular biotarget followed by quantitative structure-activity relationship-based selection of the best pharmacophore(s). The second approach is structure-based assuming that potent ligands come into contact with binding site spots distinct from those contacted by weakly potent ligands.

The preliminary hits from virtual screening were filtered for similar compounds and pan-assay interference compounds (the compounds containing reactive functional groups which can interfere with the assays) using RDKit. Further, the selected compounds were prioritized based on their molecular docking score with the binding pocket of tau where the binding pockets were identified using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation.

27515040,"Discovery of Camptothecin Based Topoisomerase I Inhibitors: Identification Using an Atom Based 3D-QSAR, Pharmacophore Modeling, Virtual Screening and Molecular Docking Approach.","BACKGROUND: Camptothecin is a quinoline alkaloid, isolated from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminate which exhibits its cytotoxic activity by the inhibition of nuclear enzyme Topoisomerase I (topo I). Camptothecin and its analogues forms a covalent bond with DNA which can arrest the tumor growth by slowing the religation step of the enzyme and stabilize the covalent adduct between topo I and DNA. Besides its strong anticancer potential, the limited solubility as well as instability of the hydroxylactone ring (Ring E) limits the clinical application of Camptothecin. This study was undertaken to identify novel compounds having anticancer activity with mechanism of action similar to that of Camptothecin using scaffold perception technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a common pharmacophore hypothesis using 32 camptothecin analogues, which was used for preliminary screening of large databases (ZINC ""drug-like"" database) to make sure, to include only compounds containing the key structural features needed to be Topoisomerase I inhibitors. In terms of a structure based approach, we systematically investigated various types of docking protocols to identify the most active compounds from the identified hit molecules. A post docking energy calculation was also carried out by MM/GBSA method. RESULTS: From the selected series of camptothecin analogs, a 3D-QSAR pharmacophore model was developed. The model consists of one acceptor site, one donor site, one hydrophobic site and two aromatic functions (ADHRR). Then, the pharmacophore model was employed as 3D search query to screen compounds from ZINC database which followed by molecular docking study and MM/GBSA calculation identified 2 lead molecules which, however, were not biologically validated. In silico studies reveals that the identified lead molecules have a better binding affinity than the co crystallized ligand. CONCLUSION: The identified molecules were able to bind to the active site of Topo-I enzyme similar to that of Camptothecin and the ADME properties were within the acceptable range defined for human use. The new molecules identified by virtual screening as such or on further optimization can be used as potential leads in designing Topoisomerase I inhibitors.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2016
36644974,"Surely you are joking, Mr Docking!","In the wake of recent COVID-19 pandemics scientists around the world rushed to deliver numerous CADD (Computer-Aided Drug Discovery) methods and tools that could be reliably used to discover novel drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With that, there emerged a trend of a significant democratization of CADD that contributed to the rapid development of various COVID-19 drug candidates currently undergoing different stages of validation. On the other hand, this democratization also inadvertently led to the surge rapidly performed molecular docking studies to nominate multiple scores of novel drug candidates supported by computational arguments only. Albeit driven by best intentions, most of such studies also did not follow best practices in the field that require experience and expertise learned through multiple rigorously designed benchmarking studies and rigorous experimental validation. In this Viewpoint we reflect on recent disbalance between small number of rigorous and comprehensive studies and the proliferation of purely computational studies enabled by the ease of docking software availability. We further elaborate on the hyped oversale of CADD methods' ability to rapidly yield viable drug candidates and reiterate the critical importance of rigor and adherence to the best practices of CADD in view of recent emergence of AI and Big Data in the field.",Chemical Society reviews,2023
30501110,Design of a Novel and Selective IRAK4 Inhibitor Using Topological Water Network Analysis and Molecular Modeling Approaches.,"Protein kinases are deeply involved in immune-related diseases and various cancers. They are a potential target for structure-based drug discovery, since the general structure and characteristics of kinase domains are relatively well-known. However, the ATP binding sites in protein kinases, which serve as target sites, are highly conserved, and thus it is difficult to develop selective kinase inhibitors. To resolve this problem, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on 26 kinases in the aqueous solution, and analyzed topological water networks (TWNs) in their ATP binding sites. Repositioning of a known kinase inhibitor in the ATP binding sites of kinases that exhibited a TWN similar to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) allowed us to identify a hit molecule. Another hit molecule was obtained from a commercial chemical library using pharmacophore-based virtual screening and molecular docking approaches. Pharmacophoric features of the hit molecules were hybridized to design a novel compound that inhibited IRAK4 at low nanomolar levels in the in vitro assay.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018
37550462,Improving drug discovery with a hybrid deep generative model using reinforcement learning trained on a Bayesian docking approximation.,"Generative approaches to molecular design are an area of intense study in recent years as a method to generate new pharmaceuticals with desired properties. Often though, these types of efforts are constrained by limited experimental activity data, resulting in either models that generate molecules with poor performance or models that are overfit and produce close analogs of known molecules. In this paper, we reduce this data dependency for the generation of new chemotypes by incorporating docking scores of known and de novo molecules to expand the applicability domain of the reward function and diversify the compounds generated during reinforcement learning. Our approach employs a deep generative model initially trained using a combination of limited known drug activity and an approximate docking score provided by a second machine learned Bayes regression model, with final evaluation of high scoring compounds by a full docking simulation. This strategy results in molecules with docking scores improved by 10-20% compared to molecules of similar size, while being 130 x faster than a docking only approach on a typical GPU workstation. We also show that the increased docking scores correlate with (1) docking poses with interactions similar to known inhibitors and (2) result in higher MM-GBSA binding energies comparable to the energies of known DDR1 inhibitors, demonstrating that the Bayesian model contains sufficient information for the network to learn to efficiently interact with the binding pocket during reinforcement learning. This outcome shows that the combination of the learned latent molecular representation along with the feature-based docking regression is sufficient for reinforcement learning to infer the relationship between the molecules and the receptor binding site, which suggest that our method can be a powerful tool for the discovery of new chemotypes with potential therapeutic applications.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2023
31732257,Discovery of covalent prolyl oligopeptidase boronic ester inhibitors.,"Over the past decade, many drug discovery endeavors have been invested in targeting the serine proteases prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and, more recently, epithelial cancers. Our research group has focused on the discovery of reversible covalent inhibitors, namely nitriles, to target the catalytic serine residue in this enzyme. While there have been many inhibitors discovered containing a nitrile to covalently bind to the catalytic serine, we have been investigating others, particularly boronic acids and boronic esters, the latter of which have been largely unexplored as covalent warheads. Herein we report a series of computationally-designed POP boronic ester pro-drug inhibitors exhibiting nanomolar-potencies in vitro as their active boronic acid species. These easily-accessible (1-2 step syntheses) compounds could facilitate future biochemical and biological studies of this enzyme's role in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer progression.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2020
28545531,Selection and characterization of alanine racemase inhibitors against Aeromonas hydrophila.,"BACKGROUND: Combining experimental and computational screening methods has been of keen interest in drug discovery. In the present study, we developed an efficient screening method that has been used to screen 2100 small-molecule compounds for alanine racemase Alr-2 inhibitors. RESULTS: We identified ten novel non-substrate Alr-2 inhibitors, of which patulin, homogentisic acid, and hydroquinone were active against Aeromonas hydrophila. The compounds were found to be capable of inhibiting Alr-2 to different extents with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) ranging from 6.6 to 17.7 muM. These compounds inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 20 to 120 mug/ml. These compounds have no activity on horseradish peroxidase and D-amino acid oxidase at a concentration of 50 muM. The MTT assay revealed that homogentisic acid and hydroquinone have minimal cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. The kinetic studies indicated a competitive inhibition of homogentisic acid against Alr-2 with an inhibition constant (K (i)) of 51.7 muM, while hydroquinone was a noncompetitive inhibitor with a K (i) of 212 muM. Molecular docking studies suggested that homogentisic acid binds to the active site of racemase, while hydroquinone lies near the active center of alanine racemase. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that combining experimental and computational methods could be used for an efficient, large-scale screening of alanine racemase inhibitors against A. hydrophila that could be applied in the development of new antibiotics against A. hydrophila.",BMC microbiology,2017
39553769,Selective protease inhibitors from secondary metabolites of Philippine medicinal plants against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: A computational veterinary drug discovery approach.,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a recurring coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea in pigs with high mortality and morbidity rates, especially in neonatal pigs. Despite the availability of vaccines, their efficacy is limited owing to antigenic differences between the vaccine and field strains, which poses a challenge to infection control. Antiviral drugs targeting conserved PEDV proteins show promise for complementing vaccination strategies. PEDV Nsp3 (PL2Pro) and Nsp5 (3CLPro) are essential proteases vital for viral replication, making them attractive targets for drug development against PEDV. AIM: To address the lack of therapeutics against recurring PEDV outbreaks and bridge the gap in the application of bioinformatics in veterinary drug discovery, this study aimed to discover compounds that inhibit PEDV proteases from Philippine medicinal plants by applying a modified virtual screening methodology that considers the physiology of swine hosts. METHODS: This study employed a library of 690 metabolites from Philippine medicinal plants to screen for potential protease inhibitors targeting PEDV PL2Pro and 3CLPro. This includes evaluating the binding affinity, pharmacokinetics, dynamic stability, and critical binding site residues. Compounds demonstrating high affinity underwent a modified ADMET analysis, considering the enteric localization of the virus and potential toxicity to swine hosts. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations assessed compound stability under physiological swine conditions. RESULTS: The study identified Bisandrographolide from Andrographis paniculata, CID 162866964 from Euphorbia neriifolia, and betulinic acid from Vitex negundo and Ocimum basilicum as metabolites that bind favorably and selectively to PEDV 3CLPro and have excellent pharmacokinetic properties and dynamic stability. In contrast, no selective inhibitor for PL2pro passed the same criteria. CONCLUSION: Employing the modified virtual screening protocol tailored for swine host considerations, the compounds identified in this study are anticipated to exert inhibitory effects against PEDV without off-target binding to analogous swine proteases and receptors. CID 162866964, bisandrographolide, and betulinic acid show promise for developing potent antivirals against PEDV.",Open veterinary journal,2024
29118091,Structure-based drug design: aiming for a perfect fit.,"Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of therapeutically relevant targets has informed drug discovery since the first protein structures were determined using X-ray crystallography in the 1950s and 1960s. In this editorial we provide a brief overview of the powerful impact of structure-based drug design (SBDD), which has its roots in computational and structural biology, with major contributions from both academia and industry. We describe advances in the application of SBDD for integral membrane protein targets that have traditionally proved very challenging. We emphasize the major progress made in fragment-based approaches for which success has been exemplified by over 30 clinical drug candidates and importantly three FDA-approved drugs in oncology. We summarize the articles in this issue that provide an excellent snapshot of the current state of the field of SBDD and fragment-based drug design and which offer key insights into exciting new developments, such as the X-ray free-electron laser technology, cryo-electron microscopy, open science approaches and targeted protein degradation. We stress the value of SBDD in the design of high-quality chemical tools that are used to interrogate biology and disease pathology, and to inform target validation. We emphasize the need to maintain the scientific rigour that has been traditionally associated with structural biology and extend this to other methods used in drug discovery. This is particularly important because the quality and robustness of any form of contributory data determines its usefulness in accelerating drug design, and therefore ultimately in providing patient benefit.",Essays in biochemistry,2017
30844267,In Silico Characterization of Structural Distinctions between Isoforms of Human and Mouse Sphingosine Kinases for Accelerating Drug Discovery.,"Alterations in cellular signaling pathways are associated with multiple disease states including cancers and fibrosis. Current research efforts to attenuate cancers, specifically lymphatic cancer, focus on inhibition of two sphingosine kinase isoforms, sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). Determining differences in structural and physicochemical binding site properties of SphKs is attractive to refine inhibitor potency and isoform selectivity. This study utilizes a predictive in silico approach to determine key differences in binding sites in SphK isoforms in human and mouse species. Homology modeling, molecular docking of inhibitors, analysis of binding pocket residue positions, development of pharmacophore models, and analysis of binding cavity volume were performed to determine isoform- and species-selective characteristics of the binding site and generate a system to rank potential inhibitors. Interestingly, docking studies showed compounds bound to mouse SphK1 in a manner more similar to human SphK2 than to human SphK1, indicating that SphKs in mice have structural properties distinct from humans that confounds prediction of ligand selectivity in mice. Our studies aid in the development and production of new compound classes by highlighting structural distinctions and identifying the role of key residues that cause observable, functional differences in isoforms and between orthologues.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019
37728805,Identifying beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitors from plant-based compounds: an approach targeting Alzheimer's therapeutics employing molecular docking and dynamics simulation.,"beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) is an enzyme that is involved in generating beta-amyloid peptides and is believed to have a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, BACE1 has gained attention as a potential therapeutic target for treating AD. Modern drug discovery studies are being conducted to identify potential inhibitors of BACE1, with the goal of reducing the production of beta-amyloid peptides and, thus, slowing the progression of AD. Here, we used a multistep virtual screening methodology to identify phytoconstituents from the IMPPAT library that could inhibit the activity of BACE1. Molecular docking was employed to select initial hits based on their binding affinity toward BACE1. Screening for PAINS patterns, ADMET and PASS properties, was then used to identify potential molecules for BACE1 inhibition. In the end, we discovered two natural compounds, Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A, which demonstrated a strong affinity, effectiveness, and specific interactions for the BACE1-active site. The elucidated molecules also displayed drug likeliness. A 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to investigate the interaction mechanism, complex stability, and conformational dynamics of BACE1 with Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A. The MD simulations demonstrated that BACE1 was stable during the simulation with Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A. Overall, the results suggested that Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A hold significant potential as scaffolds in drug development efforts targeting BACE1 for the purpose of treating AD.",Molecular diversity,2024
29359676,Computational Exploration of Natural Compounds to Target Cytosolic Phospholipase A 2 Protein: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Spinal Cord Injury.,"BACKGROUND: Cytosolic Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), an important isoform of PLA2 that mediates the release of arachidonic acid, plays a role in the pathogenesis of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). The expression and activation of Cpla2 are significantly higher in SCI, leading to neuronal death in spinal cord tissue. Novel strategies are needed to substantially reverse the effect of cPLA2 activation; one such strategy is inhibiting cPLA2 by jamming its lipid binding C2 domain. OBJECTIVE: To develop a much needed strategy to treat SCI, we used a Computer Aided Drug Design (CADD) method to discover novel cPLA2 inhibitors. METHODS: we used a natural chemiome database for virtual screening, from which we selected the compounds exhibiting the greatest drug-likeliness properties for molecular docking simulation analysis. RESULTS: We studied the interaction of lead compounds at the atomic level; the results yielded a cPLA2 inhibitor of natural origin with the potential for ameliorating secondary tissue damage and promoting recovery of function after SCI. The top compound, lead 4exibited a binding energy of -10.02 Kcal/mol and formed three hydrogen bonds with the lipid binding C2 domain of the cPLA2 protein. An evaluation of cell cytotoxicity revealed an IC50 for lead4 of 134.2 +/- 6.8 microM. An in-vitro analysis of lead4 is indicated anti-apoptotic activity via a decrease in caspase-3 expression. CONCLUSION: We used the CADD method to make a novel lead discovery for the treatment of SCI using compounds of natural origin. The selected natural compounds are non-toxic promising drugs against cPLA2 protein, allowing us to limits our focus on single compound for future in-vitro and invivo testing.",Current computer-aided drug design,2018
38415996,A simulation-based approach to target Zika virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with marine compounds for antiviral development.,"Despite significant efforts, currently, there is no particular drug available to treat Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, highlighting the urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions. To identify putative inhibitors of the ZIKV RdRp protein's RNA binding function, the present study applied an extensive in-silico drug discovery methodology. The initial phase involved virtual screening using Lipinski's rule of five as a filter, ensuring the selection of molecules with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. This process yielded 238 compounds with promising docking scores, ranging from -6.0 to -7.48 kcal/mol, indicative of their potential binding affinity to the ZIKV RdRp. To refine the selection, these compounds underwent a re-docking process, comparing their binding energies with a reference molecule known for its inhibitory action against RdRp. Remarkably, five compounds, labeled CMNPD30598, CMNPD27464, CMNPD25971, CMNPD27444, and CMNPD16599, demonstrated superior re-docking energies compared to the reference, suggesting a stronger interaction with the RdRp allosteric site. Subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided insights into the stability of these complexes over time, reinforcing their potential as RdRp inhibitors. Additionally, the calculation of free binding energies and principal component analysis (PCA) of the free energy landscape offered a deeper understanding of the binding dynamics and energetics. This study not only highlights the utility of marine fungi compounds in antiviral drug discovery but also showcases the power of computational tools in identifying novel therapeutics. The identified compounds represent promising candidates for further experimental validation and development as ZIKV RdRp inhibitors.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
35699524,Virtual Screening Expands the Non-Natural Amino Acid Palette for Peptide Optimization.,"Peptides are an important modality in drug discovery. While current peptide optimization focuses predominantly on the small number of natural and commercially available non-natural amino acids, the chemical spaces available for small molecule drug discovery are in the billions of molecules. In the present study, we describe the development of a large virtual library of readily synthesizable non-natural amino acids that can power the virtual screening protocols and aid in peptide optimization. To that end, we enumerated nearly 380 thousand amino acids and demonstrated their vast chemical diversity compared to the 20 natural and commercial residues. Furthermore, we selected a diverse ten thousand amino acid subset to validate our virtual screening workflow on the Keap1-Neh2 complex model system. Through in silico mutations of Neh2 peptide residues to those from the virtual library, our docking-based protocol identified a number of possible solutions with a significantly higher predicted affinity toward the Keap1 protein. This protocol demonstrates that the non-natural amino acid chemical space can be massively extended and virtually screened with a reasonable computational cost.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022
38316797,DynamicBind: predicting ligand-specific protein-ligand complex structure with a deep equivariant generative model.,"While significant advances have been made in predicting static protein structures, the inherent dynamics of proteins, modulated by ligands, are crucial for understanding protein function and facilitating drug discovery. Traditional docking methods, frequently used in studying protein-ligand interactions, typically treat proteins as rigid. While molecular dynamics simulations can propose appropriate protein conformations, they're computationally demanding due to rare transitions between biologically relevant equilibrium states. In this study, we present DynamicBind, a deep learning method that employs equivariant geometric diffusion networks to construct a smooth energy landscape, promoting efficient transitions between different equilibrium states. DynamicBind accurately recovers ligand-specific conformations from unbound protein structures without the need for holo-structures or extensive sampling. Remarkably, it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in docking and virtual screening benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that DynamicBind can accommodate a wide range of large protein conformational changes and identify cryptic pockets in unseen protein targets. As a result, DynamicBind shows potential in accelerating the development of small molecules for previously undruggable targets and expanding the horizons of computational drug discovery.",Nature communications,2024

However, the overall success rate remains low and screening a large library is computationally intensive. An alternative to this ""ab initio"" approach is virtual screening by binding homology search. In this approach, potential ligands are predicted based on similar interaction pairs (similarity in receptors and ligands). SPOT-Ligand is an approach that integrates ligand similarity by Tanimoto coefficient and receptor similarity by protein structure alignment program SPalign. The method was found to yield a consistent performance in DUD and DUD-E docking benchmarks even if model structures were employed. It improves over docking methods (DOCK6 and AUTODOCK Vina) and has a performance comparable to or better than other binding-homology methods (FINDsite and PoLi) with higher computational efficiency.

Pyrazoles are one of the active molecules in novel drug discovery. The present study deals about the synthesis of precursors 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(methylsulfonyl) pyrimidine-5-carbohydrazides (3a-m) from methyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-(methyl sulfonyl) pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (2) by treating with substituted acetophenone. Further, Vilsmeier-Haack reaction of compounds 3a-m at 70  degrees C for 8-10 hrs gave novel pyrazole carbaldehyde derivatives (4a-m) in good yield. Biological properties like antioxidant, anti-breast cancer and anti-inflammatory of newly synthesized compounds (4a-m) were determined. The enzymes Cyclooxygenase-2 and Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase are most responsible for the corresponding diseases such as inflammation and breast cancer respectively. In order to examine the interaction between these two enzymes and our synthesized compounds 4a-m, molecular docking study was carried out. From the results, few compounds of 4a-m were found to have anti-inflammatory properties by showing excellent COX-2 inhibition and HRBC membrane stabilization properties.

37515373,A systematic pipeline of protein structure selection for computer-aided drug discovery: A case study on T790M/L858R mutant EGFR structures.,"Virtual screening (VS) is a routine method to evaluate chemical libraries for lead identification. Therefore, the selection of appropriate protein structures for VS is an essential prerequisite to identify true actives during docking. But the presence of several crystal structures of the same protein makes it difficult to select one or few structures rationally for screening. Therefore, a computational prioritization protocol has been developed for shortlisting crystal structures that identify true active molecules with better efficiency. As identification of small-molecule inhibitors is an important clinical requirement for the T790M/L858R (TMLR) EGFR mutant, it has been selected as a case study. The approach involves cross-docking of 21 co-crystal ligands with all the structures of the same protein to select structures that dock non-native ligands with lower RMSD. The cross docking performance was then correlated with ligand similarity and binding-site conformational similarity. Eventually, structures were shortlisted by integrating cross-docking performance, and ligand and binding-site similarity. Thereafter, binding pose metadynamics was employed to identify structures having stable co-crystal ligands in their respective binding pockets. Finally, different enrichment metrics like BEDROC, RIE, AUAC, and EF(1%) were evaluated leading to the identification of five TMLR structures (5HCX, 5CAN, 5CAP, 5CAS, and 5CAO). These structures docked a number of non-native ligands with low RMSD, contain structurally dissimilar ligands, have conformationally dissimilar binding sites, harbor stable co-crystal ligands, and also identify true actives early. The present approach can be implemented for shortlisting protein targets of any other important therapeutic kinases.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2023

Recently, flavones have shown anti-dengue activities by interfering with viral translation and replication. However, the molecular target is still elusive. Here we chemically modified apigenin by adding an alkyne moiety into the B-ring hydroxyl group. The alkyne serves as a chemical tag for the alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction for subcellular visualization. The compound located at the perinuclear region at 1 and 6 h after infection. Interestingly, the compound signal started shifting to vesicle-like structures at 6 h and accumulated at 24 and 48 h after infection. Moreover, the compound treatment in dengue-infected cells showed that the compound restricted the viral protein inside the vesicles, especially at 48 h. As a result, the dengue envelope proteins spread throughout the cells. The alkyne-tagged apigenin showed a more potent efficacy at the EC(50) of 2.36 +/- 0.22, and 10.55 +/- 3.37 microM, respectively, while the cytotoxicities were similar to the original apigenin at the CC(50) of 70.34 +/- 11.79, and 82.82 +/- 11.68 microM, respectively. Molecular docking confirmed the apigenin binding to the previously reported target, ribosomal protein S9, at two binding sites. The network analysis, homopharma, and molecular docking revealed that the estrogen receptor 1 and viral NS1 were potential targets at the late infection stage. The interactions could attenuate dengue productivity by interfering with viral translation and suppressing the viral proteins from trafficking to the cell surface.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021

One of this cancer's most important risk factors is HPV infection. In the approach to finding an effective treatment for this disease, various works have been done around genomics and drug discovery. Finding the major altered genes was one of the most significant studies completed in the field of cervical cancer by TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), and these genes are TGFBR2, MED1, ERBB3, CASP8, and HLA-A. The greatest genomic alterations were found in the PI3K/MAPK and TGF-Beta signalling pathways, suggesting that numerous therapeutic targets may come from these pathways in the future. We, therefore, conducted a combined enrichment analysis of genes gathered from various works of literature for this study. The final six key genes from the list were obtained after enrichment analysis using GO, KEGG, and Reactome methods. The six proteins against the identified genes were then subjected to a docking-based screening against a library of 6,87,843 prepared natural compounds from the ZINC15 database. The most stable compound was subsequently discovered through virtual screening to be the natural substance Quinic acid, which also had the highest binding affinity for all six proteins and a better docking score. To examine their stability, the study was extended to MM/GBSA and MD simulations on the six docked proteins, and comparative docking-based calculations led us to identify the Quinic Acid as a multitargeted compound. The overall deviation of the compound was less than 2 A for all the complexes considered best for the biological molecules, and the simulation interaction analysis reveals a huge web of interaction during the simulation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

In order to identify such new inhibitors, we established a combinatorial screening method based on acylhydrazone chemistry. This represents a novel application of combinatorial chemistry focusing on the improvement of physicochemical properties, rather than on potency. This strategy allowed us to efficiently screen 44 reaction mixtures of different hydrazides and our previously reported indole aldehyde core structure, without the need for individual synthesis of all possible combinations of building blocks. Our approach afforded three new inhibitors with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range and improved lipophilic ligand efficiency.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019

The therapeutic efficacy of current influenza vaccines and small molecule antiviral drugs is limited due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant influenza viruses. In response to the urgent need for the next generation of influenza antivirals, we utilized a fast-track drug discovery platform by exploring multi-component reaction products for antiviral drug candidates. Specifically, molecular docking was applied to screen a small molecule library derived from the Ugi-azide four-component reaction methodology for inhibitors that target the influenza polymerase PA(C)-PB1(N) interactions. One hit compound 5 was confirmed to inhibit PA(C)-PB1(N) interactions in an ELISA assay and had potent antiviral activity in an antiviral plaque assay. Subsequent structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of compound 12a, which had broad-spectrum antiviral activity and a higher in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance than oseltamivir. Overall, the discovery of compound 12a as a broad-spectrum influenza antiviral with a high in vitro genetic barrier to drug resistance is significant, as it offers a second line of defense to combat the next influenza epidemics and pandemics if vaccines and oseltamivir fail to confine the disease outbreak.",Scientific reports,2018
35566155,Identification of Mtb GlmU Uridyltransferase Domain Inhibitors by Ligand-Based and Structure-Based Drug Design Approaches.,"Targeting enzymes that play a role in the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall has long been a strategy for antibacterial discovery. In particular, the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a complex of three layers, one of which is Peptidoglycan, an essential component providing rigidity and strength. UDP-GlcNAc, a precursor for the synthesis of peptidoglycan, is formed by GlmU, a bi-functional enzyme. Inhibiting GlmU Uridyltransferase activity has been proven to be an effective anti-bacterial, but its similarity with human enzymes has been a deterrent to drug development. To develop Mtb selective hits, the Mtb GlmU substrate binding pocket was compared with structurally similar human enzymes to identify selectivity determining factors. Substrate binding pockets and conformational changes upon substrate binding were analyzed and MD simulations with substrates were performed to quantify crucial interactions to develop critical pharmacophore features. Thereafter, two strategies were applied to propose potent and selective bacterial GlmU Uridyltransferase domain inhibitors: (i) optimization of existing inhibitors, and (ii) identification by virtual screening. The binding modes of hits identified from virtual screening and ligand growing approaches were evaluated further for their ability to retain stable contacts within the pocket during 20 ns MD simulations. Hits that are predicted to be more potent than existing inhibitors and selective against human homologues could be of great interest for rejuvenating drug discovery efforts towards targeting the Mtb cell wall for antibacterial discovery.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022
39616546,Molecular simulations and machine learning methods for the identification of novel aurora A kinase inhibitors.,"Aurora A kinase (AAK) is a serine/threonine kinase that stands out as a crucial regulator of mitosis, the complex process of cell division. Notably, the protein AAK plays vital roles in cell cycle regulation and encompasses centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. All such functionalities are essential for ensuring accurate daughter cell formation. Deregulation of AAK expression and activity has been linked to various human diseases, particularly cancer. However, AAK's significance extends beyond normal cellular function. Increased expression or activity of AAK has been implicated in the development and progression of several human cancers. AAK's critical role in cell division and its association with cancer make it a prominent drug target. Herein, series of advance computational approaches was utilized including multi-step molecular docking through AutoDock Vina and PLANTS docking to screen ChemDiv kinase-specific inhibitor library against AAK. Absolute binding energy was estimated, and finally, a molecular dynamics simulation study was conducted to screen out three hit compounds. Both docking studies revealed perfect binding of all identified ligands in active site pockets of AAK protein with similar amino acids of active sites as compared with standard BindingDB_50433632 compound and co-crystal ligand VX-680 binding mode of AAK protein. Therefore, it can be concluded that computational drug discovery approaches are meticulously implemented to identify potential AAKs inhibitors/modulators, and credential of the work was substantiated through the identification of three potential AAKs inhibitors/modulators that may hold significant promise for improving cancer management, however, need extensive biological assays or pre-clinical trials for assessing the efficacy profile of the identified compounds.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
39673863,Combined usage of ligand- and structure-based virtual screening in the artificial intelligence era.,"Drug design has always been pursuing techniques with time- and cost-benefits. Virtual screening, generally classified as ligand-based (LBVS) and structure-based (SBVS) approaches, could identify active compounds in the large chemical library to reduce time and cost. Owing to the intrinsic flaws and complementary nature of both approaches, continued efforts have been made to combine them to mitigate limitations. Meanwhile, the emergence of machine learning (ML) endows them with opportunities to leverage vast amounts of data to improve their defects. However, few discussions on how to merge ML-improved LBVS and SBVS have been conducted. Therefore, this review provides insights into combined usage of ML-improved LBVS and SBVS to enlighten medicinal chemists to utilize these joint strategies to lift the screening efficiency as well as AI professionals to design novel techniques.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2025
33065388,In silico drug discovery of major metabolites from spices as SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), originally identified in Wuhan, China (December 2019) and has since expanded into a pandemic. Here, we investigate metabolites present in several common spices as possible inhibitors of COVID-19. Specifically, 32 compounds isolated from 14 cooking seasonings were examined as inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), which is required for viral multiplication. Using a drug discovery approach to identify possible antiviral leads, in silico molecular docking studies were performed. Docking calculations revealed a high potency of salvianolic acid A and curcumin as M(pro) inhibitors with binding energies of -9.7 and -9.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Binding mode analysis demonstrated the ability of salvianolic acid A and curcumin to form nine and six hydrogen bonds, respectively with amino acids proximal to M(pro)'s active site. Stabilities and binding affinities of the two identified natural spices were calculated over 40 ns molecular dynamics simulations and compared to an antiviral protease inhibitor (lopinavir). Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area energy calculations revealed greater salvianolic acid A affinity for the enzyme over curcumin and lopinavir with energies of -44.8, -34.2 and -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Using a STRING database, protein-protein interactions were identified for salvianolic acid A included the biochemical signaling genes ACE, MAPK14 and ESR1; and for curcumin, EGFR and TNF. This study establishes salvianolic acid A as an in silico natural product inhibitor against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and provides a promising inhibitor lead for in vitro enzyme testing.",Computers in biology and medicine,2020
28689054,Implementing QM in docking calculations: is it a waste of computational time?,"The greatest challenge in molecular docking (MD) is the deficiency of scoring functions (SFs), which limits their reliability. SFs are too simplified to represent the true features of the complex free energy of protein-ligand interactions. Investigations of docking functions have traded accuracy for speed through the use of approximations and simplifications. Consequently, there has been an increase in the popularity of quantum-mechanical (QM)-based methods as reference points for the development of fast, reliable, valuable, yet inexpensive, tools. As we discuss here, one significant QM-based parameter used to predict docking is the accuracy of atomic partial charges, which is strongly related to the accuracy of the SF prediction.",Drug discovery today,2017

39568436,Validation guidelines for drug-target prediction methods.,"INTRODUCTION: Mapping the interactions between pharmaceutical compounds and their molecular targets is a fundamental aspect of drug discovery and repurposing. Drug-target interactions are important for elucidating mechanisms of action and optimizing drug efficacy and safety profiles. Several computational methods have been developed to systematically predict drug-target interactions. However, computational and experimental validation of the drug-target predictions greatly vary across the studies. AREAS COVERED: Through a PubMed query, a corpus comprising 3,286 articles on drug-target interaction prediction published within the past decade was covered. Natural language processing was used for automated abstract classification to study the evolution of computational methods, validation strategies and performance assessment metrics in the 3,286 articles. Additionally, a manual analysis of 259 studies that performed experimental validation of computational predictions revealed prevalent experimental protocols. EXPERT OPINION: Starting from 2014, there has been a noticeable increase in articles focusing on drug-target interaction prediction. Docking and regression stands out as the most commonly used techniques among computational methods, and cross-validation is frequently employed as the computational validation strategy. Testing the predictions using multiple, orthogonal validation strategies is recommended and should be reported for the specific target prediction applications. Experimental validation remains relatively rare and should be performed more routinely to evaluate biological relevance of predictions.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2025

However, there is no BAZ1A inhibitor reported so far. In this study, we used a consensus docking/scoring strategy to screen for BAZ1A bromodomain inhibitors from commercial chemical libraries and an in-house chemical database. The retrieved hit compounds were evaluated experimentally and four compounds were found to be active against BAZ1A bromodomain. To the most active compounds, similarity and substructure searches were used to find more BAZ1A bromodomain inhibitors. Among all the obtained active compounds, Cpd-2 is the most potent one, which showed a K(D) value of 0.52 muM. The interaction model of Cpd-2 with BAZ1A bromodomain was revealed by molecular docking. In a cellular assay, Cpd-2 displayed good anti-viability activity against cancer cell lines expressing a high level of BAZ1A. Overall, we discovered a number of BAZ1A bromodomain inhibitors for the first time, which can be a good starting point for subsequent drug discovery targeting BAZ1A bromodomain.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2021
28221352,Dynamic undocking and the quasi-bound state as tools for drug discovery.,"There is a pressing need for new technologies that improve the efficacy and efficiency of drug discovery. Structure-based methods have contributed towards this goal but they focus on predicting the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes, which is notoriously difficult. We adopt an alternative approach that evaluates structural, rather than thermodynamic, stability. As bioactive molecules present a static binding mode, we devised dynamic undocking (DUck), a fast computational method to calculate the work necessary to reach a quasi-bound state at which the ligand has just broken the most important native contact with the receptor. This non-equilibrium property is surprisingly effective in virtual screening because true ligands form more-resilient interactions than decoys. Notably, DUck is orthogonal to docking and other 'thermodynamic' methods. We demonstrate the potential of the docking-undocking combination in a fragment screening against the molecular chaperone and oncology target Hsp90, for which we obtain novel chemotypes and a hit rate that approaches 40%.",Nature chemistry,2017
38460065,First report on chemometrics-driven multilayered lead prioritization in addressing oxysterol-mediated overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor 183.,"Contemporary research has convincingly demonstrated that upregulation of G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183), orchestrated by its endogenous agonist, 7alpha,25-dihydroxyxcholesterol (7alpha,25-OHC), leads to the development of cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, infectious, and inflammatory diseases. A recent study unveiled the cryo-EM structure of 7alpha,25-OHC bound GPR183 complex, presenting an untapped opportunity for computational exploration of potential GPR183 inhibitors, which served as our inspiration for the current work. A predictive and validated two-dimensional QSAR model using genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) on experimental GPR183 inhibition data was developed. QSAR study highlighted that structural features like dissimilar electronegative atoms, quaternary carbon atoms, and CH(2)RX fragment (X: heteroatoms) influence positively, while the existence of oxygen atoms with a topological separation of 3, negatively affects GPR183 inhibitory activity. Post assessment of true external set prediction capability, the MLR model was deployed to screen 12,449 DrugBank compounds, followed by a screening pipeline involving molecular docking, druglikeness, ADMET, protein-ligand stability assessment using deep learning algorithm, molecular dynamics, and molecular mechanics.

39551420,Harnessing computational and experimental approaches to identify potent hits against Leishmania donovani sterol C-24 methyltransferase from ChemBridge library.,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease and is one of the major causes of mortality in poverty-stricken areas. A limited chemotherapeutics arsenal is available to tackle this deadly infection. Thus, identifying novel potent scaffolds using innovative strategies is the need of the hour. High-throughput screening (HTS) is a critical technique that can accelerate the process of drug discovery by evaluating millions of drug-like molecules using various automation tools and biological assays. In the present study, we have employed the HTS strategy to identify potent hits against Leishmania donovani sterol C-24 methyltransferase (LdSMT) from the in-house ChemBridge library. Firstly, a robust dataset was prepared with previously reported sterol C-24 methyltransferase inhibitors, belonging to diverse structural classes. Then, ligand-based virtual screening using similarity search was performed to screen the ChemBridge library having  approximately 20,000 molecules. This computational approach yielded 81 candidate compounds, which were selected for further molecular docking and biological evaluation. Anti-leishmanial assays revealed that out of 81 molecules, seven showed potential parasitic killing. Three molecules namely IIIM-CB-14, IIIM-CB-29, and IIIM-CB-45 were the most potent ones with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 5.76, 8.08, and 10.64 microg/mL, respectively. SEM analyses suggest that these potent hits cause considerable morphological alterations. ADME studies of the potent hit molecules indicate that all the hits have considerable drug-likeness properties. Further, molecular dynamics studies were also performed to check the stable confirmation of LdSMT protein with the top two hits (IIIM-CB-14 and IIIM-CB-45).

Its mortality and morbidity are predicted to increase over the next decade, hence, efforts aimed at combating it have remained unabated. In the context of its treatment, the use of chemotherapeutics is often limited by challenges including cost-ineffectiveness, side effects, and drug resistance. Hence, medicinal plants are actively being explored for alternatives. In this study, Allium sativum (A. sativum) was explored for the discovery of key compounds that are worthy of exploration in the context of CRC treatment and the potential mechanism of its anti-CRC effects. The bioactive compounds of A. sativum were retrieved and subjected to drug-likeness and pharmacokinetics properties evaluation, the putative targets of compounds with admirable properties were predicted using PharmMapper while the targets of CRC were retrieved from GeneCards. The interactions between the targets common to both were retrieved from the String database while Cytoscape software was used to visualize and analyze the interactions. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) study revealed the biological processes and pathways A. sativum could potentially restore in CRC. These analyses revealed the key targets via which A. sativum compounds exert their anti-CRC properties, while molecular docking studies of the key compounds against the key targets revealed beta-sitosterol and alpha-bisabolene as the compounds with the highest binding affinity for the key targets. Ultimately, further experimental studies are needed to validate the findings of this study.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2024

IC(50) values of the investigated compounds are mostly affected by the substituted R(2) phenyl moiety. The calculations show that the presence of electron withdrawing group increases the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)). Structure-activity relationship studies show that the electronic descriptors, energy of high occupied molecular orbital, DeltaE, lipophilicity, hardness, and ionization potential index, are the most significant descriptors for the correlation with IC(50).

28431169,SPA-LN: a scoring function of ligand-nucleic acid interactions via optimizing both specificity and affinity.,"Nucleic acids have been widely recognized as potential targets in drug discovery and aptamer selection. Quantifying the interactions between small molecules and nucleic acids is critical to discover lead compounds and design novel aptamers. Scoring function is normally employed to quantify the interactions in structure-based virtual screening. However, the predictive power of nucleic acid-ligand scoring functions is still a challenge compared to other types of biomolecular recognition. With the rapid growth of experimentally determined nucleic acid-ligand complex structures, in this work, we develop a knowledge-based scoring function of nucleic acid-ligand interactions, namely SPA-LN. SPA-LN is optimized by maximizing both the affinity and specificity of native complex structures. The development strategy is different from those of previous nucleic acid-ligand scoring functions which focus on the affinity only in the optimization. The native conformation is stabilized while non-native conformations are destabilized by our optimization, making the funnel-like binding energy landscape more biased toward the native state. The performance of SPA-LN validates the development strategy and provides a relatively more accurate way to score the nucleic acid-ligand interactions.",Nucleic acids research,2017

A number of factors like disease's non-specific symptoms, increased viral mutation, growing antiviral drug resistance due to reduced susceptibility, unavailability of an effective vaccine for dengue, weak immunity against the virus, and many more are involved. Dengue belongs to the Flaviviridae family of viruses. The two species of the vector transmitting dengue are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, with the former one being dominant. Serotypes 2 of dengue fever are spread to the human body and cause severe illness. Recently, dengue has imposed an aggressive effect synergistically with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we concentrated our efforts on finding a potential therapeutic. For this, we chose natural compounds to fight dengue fever, which is currently regarded as successful among many drug therapies. Following this, we started the in silico experiment with 922 plant extracts as lead compounds to fight serotype 2.

26042856,Solving molecular docking problems with multi-objective metaheuristics.,"Molecular docking is a hard optimization problem that has been tackled in the past with metaheuristics, demonstrating new and challenging results when looking for one objective: the minimum binding energy. However, only a few papers can be found in the literature that deal with this problem by means of a multi-objective approach, and no experimental comparisons have been made in order to clarify which of them has the best overall performance. In this paper, we use and compare, for the first time, a set of representative multi-objective optimization algorithms applied to solve complex molecular docking problems. The approach followed is focused on optimizing the intermolecular and intramolecular energies as two main objectives to minimize. Specifically, these algorithms are: two variants of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), speed modulation multi-objective particle swarm optimization (SMPSO), third evolution step of generalized differential evolution (GDE3), multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and S-metric evolutionary multi-objective optimization (SMS-EMOA). We assess the performance of the algorithms by applying quality indicators intended to measure convergence and the diversity of the generated Pareto front approximations. We carry out a comparison with another reference mono-objective algorithm in the problem domain (Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) provided by the AutoDock tool). Furthermore, the ligand binding site and molecular interactions of computed solutions are analyzed, showing promising results for the multi-objective approaches. In addition, a case study of application for aeroplysinin-1 is performed, showing the effectiveness of our multi-objective approach in drug discovery.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2015

In a discovery of anti-influenza agents with epigoitrin as the initial lead compound, a series of 1-amino-2-alkanols were synthesized and biologically evaluated. The in vitro evaluation indicated that (E)-1-amino-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-ol (C1) had better inhibitory activities than 2-amino-1-arylethan-1-ol derivatives. To our surprise, sulfonation of C1 with 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride afforded more active inhibitor II with up to 6.4 muM IC(50) value against neuraminidase. Furthermore, docking of inhibitor II into the active site of NA found that the H atoms in both NH(2) and OH groups of inhibitor II were the key factors for potency.

38565409,"Discovery and validation of anti-arthritic ingredients and mechanisms of Qingfu Juanbi Tang, a Chinese herbal formulation, on rheumatoid arthritis.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Qingfu Juanbi Tang (QFJBT), a novel and improved Chinese herbal formulation, has surged in recent years for its potential in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-arthritic effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of QFJBT have increasingly become a focal point in research. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study utilized network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation to elucidate effective ingredients and anti-arthritic mechanisms of QFJBT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Targets associated with QFJBT and RA were identified from relevant databases and standardized using the Uniprot for gene nomenclature. A ""QFJBT-ingredient-target network"" and a ""Venn diagram of QFJBT and RA targets"" were created from the data. The overlap in the Venn diagram highlighted potential targets of QFJBT in the treatment of RA. These targets were subjected to PPI network, GO, and KEGG pathway analysis. The findings were subsequently confirmed through molecular docking and pharmacological experiments to propose the mechanism of action of QFJBT. RESULTS: The study identified 236 active ingredients in QFJBT, with 120 predicted to be effective against RA. Molecular docking showed high binding affinity of key targets (JUN, PTGS2, and TNF-alpha) with bioactive compounds (rhein, sinomenine, calycosin, and paeoniflorin) of QFJBT. Pharmacodynamic evaluation demonstrated the effects of QFJBT at the dose of 4.56 g/kg in ameliorating symptoms of AIA rats and in reducing levels of JUN, PTGS2, and TNF-alpha in synovial tissues. In vitro studies further exhibited that rhein, paeoniflorin, sinomenine, calycosin, and QFJBT-containing serum significantly inhibited abnormal proliferation of RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Interestingly, rhein and paeoniflorin specifically decreased p-JUN/JUN expression and TNF-alpha release, respectively, while sinomenine and calycosin selectively increased PTGS2 expression. Consistently, QFJBT-containing serum demonstrated similar effects as those active ingredients identified in QFJBT did. CONCLUSIONS: QFJBT, QFJBT-containing serum, and its active ingredients (rhein, paeoniflorin, sinomenine, and calycosin) suppress inflammatory responses in RA. Anti-arthritic effects of QFJBT and its active ingredients are likely linked to their modulatory impact on identified hub targets.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2024

Extensive researches have shown that aging reduces sensibility of AMPK and eventually causes energy imbalance in cells. Research in mammals' AMPK depicts that this signaling molecule could control autophagy, improve cellular stress resistance and suppress inflammatory responses. Hence, in this study we performed a drug repurposing of 1908 FDA-approved drugs in order to discover putative safe activators of AMPK and to find new applications for existing drugs. For this purpose, FDA-approved drugs were screened by virtual screening and the ligand-protein interactions were carefully inspected. Moreover, through MM/PBSA analysis, the binding affinity of hit compounds in gamma and alphabeta binding sites were investigated. As Cangrelor, Nacitentan, Levoleucovorin and Glisoxepide had lower binding affinities; we predicted that they would probably prove to be more potential activators than C2. However, hit-compounds in alphabeta binding site, exhibited higher unfavorable binding affinity. Hence, present findings can prove to be valuable for discovering new activators for AMPK.",Biogerontology,2018

We developed a set of new empirical scoring functions, named DockTScore, by explicitly accounting for physics-based terms combined with machine learning. Target-specific scoring functions were developed for two important drug targets, proteases and protein-protein interactions, representing an original class of molecules for drug discovery. Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine and random forest algorithms were employed to derive general and target-specific scoring functions involving optimized MMFF94S force-field terms, solvation and lipophilic interactions terms, and an improved term accounting for ligand torsional entropy contribution to ligand binding. DockTScore scoring functions demonstrated to be competitive with the current best-evaluated scoring functions in terms of binding energy prediction and ranking on four DUD-E datasets and will be useful for in silico drug design for diverse proteins as well as for specific targets such as proteases and protein-protein interactions. Currently, the MLR DockTScore is available at www.dockthor.lncc.br .",Scientific reports,2021
30207403,Discovery of Small Molecule WWP2 Ubiquitin Ligase Inhibitors.,"We have screened small molecule libraries specifically for inhibitors that target WWP2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase associated with tumour outgrowth and spread. Selected hits demonstrated dose-dependent WWP2 inhibition, low micromolar IC50 values, and inhibition of PTEN substrate-specific ubiquitination. Binding to WWP2 was confirmed by ligand-based NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we used a combination of STD NMR, the recently developed DEEP-STD NMR approach, and docking calculations, to propose for the first time an NMR-validated 3D molecular model of a WWP2-inhibitor complex. These first generation WWP2 inhibitors provide a molecular framework for informing organic synthetic approaches to improve activity and selectivity.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2018
39340358,Accurate Conformation Sampling via Protein Structural Diffusion.,"Accurate sampling of protein conformations is pivotal for advances in biology and medicine. Although there has been tremendous progress in protein structure prediction in recent years due to deep learning, models that can predict the different stable conformations of proteins with high accuracy and structural validity are still lacking. Here, we introduce UFConf, a cutting-edge approach designed for robust sampling of diverse protein conformations based solely on amino acid sequences. This method transforms AlphaFold2 into a diffusion model by implementing a conformation-based diffusion process and adapting the architecture to process diffused inputs effectively. To counteract the inherent conformational bias in the Protein Data Bank, we developed a novel hierarchical reweighting protocol based on structural clustering. Our evaluations demonstrate that UFConf outperforms existing methods in terms of successful sampling and structural validity. The comparisons with long-time molecular dynamics show that UFConf can overcome the energy barrier existing in molecular dynamics simulations and perform more efficient sampling. Furthermore, We showcase UFConf's utility in drug discovery through its application in neural protein-ligand docking. In a blind test, it accurately predicted a novel protein-ligand complex, underscoring its potential to impact real-world biological research. Additionally, we present other modes of sampling using UFConf, including partial sampling with fixed motif, Langevin dynamics, and structural interpolation.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024

With rising resistance to current antibiotics and limited solutions, the urgent discovery of new, effective, and affordable antibacterials with low toxicity is imperative to combat diverse MDR S. aureus strains. Hence, in this study, we introduce an in silico phytochemical-based approach for discovering novel antibacterial agents, underscoring the potential of computational approaches in therapeutic discovery. Glucomoringin Isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) from Moringa oleifera Lam. is one of the phytochemical compounds with several biological activities, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, and is also effective against S. aureus. This study focuses on screening GMG-ITC as a potential drug candidate to combat MDR S. aureus infections through a molecular docking approach. Moreover, interaction amino acid analysis, in silico pharmacokinetics, compound target prediction, pathway enrichment analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for further investigation. Molecular docking and interaction analysis showed strong binding affinity towards S. aureus lipase, dihydrofolate reductase, and other MDR S. aureus proteins, including penicillin-binding protein 2a, MepR, D-Ala:D-Ala ligase, and RPP TetM, through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. GMG-ITC also showed a strong binding affinity to cyclooxygenase-2 and FAD-dependent NAD(P)H oxidase, suggesting that it is a potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant candidate that may eliminate inflammation and oxidative stress associated with S. aureus infections. MD simulations validated the stability of the GMG-ITC molecular interactions determined by molecular docking. In silico pharmacokinetic analysis highlights its potency as a drug candidate, showing strong absorption, distribution, and excretion properties in combination with low toxicity. It acts as an active protease and enzyme inhibitor with moderate activity against GPCR ligands, ion channels, nuclear receptor ligands, and kinases. Enrichment analysis further elucidated its involvement in important biological, molecular, and cellular functions with potential therapeutic applications in diseases like cancer, hepatitis B, and influenza.

37378542,Building polarization into protein-inhibitor binding dynamics in rational drug design for rheumatoid arthritis.,"Standard force field-based simulations to accomplish structure-based evaluations of lead molecules is a powerful tool. Combining protein fragmentation into tractable sub-systems with continuum solvation method is envisaged to enable quantum mechanics-based electronic structure calculations of macromolecules in their realistic environment. This along with incorporation of many-body polarization effect in molecular dynamics simulations may augment an accurate description of electrostatics of protein-inhibitor systems for effective drug design. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disorder plagued by the ceiling effect of current targeted therapies, encouraging identification of new druggable targets and corresponding drug design to tackle the refractory form of disease. In this study, polarization-inclusive force field approach has been used to model protein solvation and ligand binding for 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase' (MAP3K8), a regulatory node of notable pharmacological relevance in RA synovial biology. For MAP3K8 inhibitors belonging to different scaffold series, the calculations illustrated differential electrostatic contribution to their relative binding affinities and successfully explained examples from available structure-activity relationship studies. Results from this study exemplified i) the advantage of this approach in reliably ranking inhibitors having close nanomolar range activities for the same target; and ii) its prospective application in lead molecule identification aiding drug discovery efforts in RA.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

38838751,"Discovery of putative inhibitors of human Pkd1 enzyme: Molecular docking, dynamics and simulation, QSAR, and MM/GBSA.","Polycystic kidney disease is the most prevalent hereditary kidney disease globally and is mainly linked to the overexpression of a gene called PKD1. To date, there is no effective treatment available for polycystic kidney disease, and the practicing treatments only provide symptomatic relief. Discovery of the compounds targeting the PKD1 gene by inhibiting its expression under the disease condition could be crucial for effective drug development. In this study, a molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation, QSAR, and MM/GBSA-based approaches were used to determine the putative inhibitors of the Pkd1 enzyme from a library of 1379 compounds. Initially, fourteen compounds were selected based on their binding affinities with the Pkd1 enzyme using MOE and AutoDock tools. The selected drugs were further investigated to explore their properties as drug candidates and the stability of their complex formation with the Pkd1 enzyme. Based on the physicochemical and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties, and toxicity profiling, two compounds including olsalazine and diosmetin were selected for the downstream analysis as they demonstrated the best drug-likeness properties and highest binding affinity with Pkd1 in the docking experiment. Molecular dynamic simulation using Gromacs further confirmed the stability of olsalazine and diosmetin complexes with Pkd1 and establishing interaction through strong bonding with specific residues of protein. High biological activity and binding free energies of two complexes calculated using 3D QSAR and Schrodinger module, respectively further validated our results. Therefore, the molecular docking and dynamics simulation-based in-silico approach used in this study revealed olsalazine and diosmetin as potential drug candidates to combat polycystic kidney disease by targeting Pkd1 enzyme.",Environmental research,2024
34799816,Fine tuning for success in structure-based virtual screening.,"Structure-based virtual screening plays a significant role in drug-discovery. The method virtually docks millions of compounds from corporate or public libraries into a binding site of a disease-related protein structure, allowing for the selection of a small list of potential ligands for experimental testing. Many algorithms are available for docking and assessing the affinity of compounds for a targeted protein site. The performance of affinity estimation calculations is highly dependent on the size and nature of the site, therefore a rationale for selecting the best protocol is required. To address this issue, we have developed an automated calibration process, implemented in a Knime workflow. It consists of four steps: preparation of a protein test set with structures and models of the target, preparation of a compound test set with target-related ligands and decoys, automatic test of 24 scoring/rescoring protocols for each target structure and model, and graphical display of results. The automation of the process combined with execution on high performance computing resources greatly reduces the duration of the calibration phase, and the test of many combinations of algorithms on various target conformations results in a rational and optimal choice of the best protocol. Here, we present this tool and exemplify its application in setting-up an optimal protocol for SBVS against Retinoid X Receptor alpha.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2021

26990888,The impact of crystallization conditions on structure-based drug design: A case study on the methylene blue/acetylcholinesterase complex.,"Structure-based drug design utilizes apoprotein or complex structures retrieved from the PDB. >57% of crystallographic PDB entries were obtained with polyethylene glycols (PEGs) as precipitant and/or as cryoprotectant, but <6% of these report presence of individual ethyleneglycol oligomers. We report a case in which ethyleneglycol oligomers' presence in a crystal structure markedly affected the bound ligand's position. Specifically, we compared the positions of methylene blue and decamethonium in acetylcholinesterase complexes obtained using isomorphous crystals precipitated with PEG200 or ammonium sulfate. The ligands' positions within the active-site gorge in complexes obtained using PEG200 are influenced by presence of ethyleneglycol oligomers in both cases bound to W84 at the gorge's bottom, preventing interaction of the ligand's proximal quaternary group with its indole. Consequently, both ligands are  approximately 3.0A further up the gorge than in complexes obtained using crystals precipitated with ammonium sulfate, in which the quaternary groups make direct pi-cation interactions with the indole. These findings have implications for structure-based drug design, since data for ligand-protein complexes with polyethylene glycol as precipitant may not reflect the ligand's position in its absence, and could result in selecting incorrect drug discovery leads. Docking methylene blue into the structure obtained with PEG200, but omitting the ethyleneglycols, yields results agreeing poorly with the crystal structure; excellent agreement is obtained if they are included. Many proteins display features in which precipitants might lodge. It will be important to investigate presence of precipitants in published crystal structures, and whether it has resulted in misinterpreting electron density maps, adversely affecting drug design.",Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2016

24954187,Computer-aided drug discovery approach finds calcium sensitizer of cardiac troponin.,"In the fight against heart failure, therapeutics that have the ability to increase the contractile power of the heart are urgently needed. One possible route of action to improve heart contractile power is increasing the calcium sensitivity of the thin filament. From a pharmaceutical standpoint, calcium sensitizers have the distinct advantage of not altering cardiomyocyte calcium levels and thus have lower potential for side-effects. Small chemical molecules have been shown to bind to the interface between cTnC and the cTnI switch peptide and exhibit calcium-sensitizing properties, possibly by stabilizing cTnC in an open conformation. Building on existing structural data of a known calcium sensitizer bound to cardiac troponin, we combined computational structure-based virtual screening drug discovery methods and solution NMR titration assays to identify a novel calcium sensitizer 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NSC147866) which binds to cTnC and the cTnC-cTnI147-163 complex.

However, it is still a challenge to generate molecules with expected properties, especially high activity. Here, to obtain compounds both with novelty and high activity to a target, we proposed a conditional molecular generation model COMG by considering the docking score and 3D pharmacophore matching during molecular generation. The proposed model was based on the conditional variational autoencoder architecture constrained by the pharmacophore matching score. During Bayesian optimization, the docking score was applied to enhance the target relevance of generated compounds. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of high structural similarity caused by Bayesian optimization, the idea of the scaffold memory unit was also introduced. The evaluation results of COMG show that our model not only can improve the structural diversity of generated molecules but also can effectively improve the proportion of target-related drug-active molecules. The obtained results indicate that our proposed model COMG is a useful drug design tool.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2023

Further, we demonstrated the application of GCDB in a case study screening two chemical libraries, Maybridge and Specs, to identify interactions between small molecules and glaucoma-related proteins. Finally, six and four compounds were selected from the final hits for in vitro human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) and adenosine A3 receptor (A3AR) inhibitory assays, respectively. Of these compounds, six were shown to have inhibitory activities against hGR, with IC50 values ranging from 2.92-28.43 muM, whereas one compoundshowed inhibitory activity against A3AR, with an IC50 of 6.15 muM. Overall, GCDB will be helpful in target identification and glaucoma chemogenomics data exchange and sharing, and facilitate drug discovery for glaucoma treatment.",Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2018
28164720,Applications of computer-aided approaches in the development of hepatitis C antiviral agents.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health problem that causes several chronic life-threatening liver diseases. The numbers of people affected by HCV are rising annually. Since 2011, the FDA has approved several anti-HCV drugs; while many other promising HCV drugs are currently in late clinical trials. Areas covered: This review discusses the applications of different computational approaches in HCV drug design. Expert opinion: Molecular docking and virtual screening approaches have emerged as a low-cost tool to screen large databases and identify potential small-molecule hits against HCV targets. Ligand-based approaches are useful for filtering-out compounds with rich physicochemical properties to inhibit HCV targets. Molecular dynamics (MD) remains a useful tool in optimizing the ligand-protein complexes and understand the ligand binding modes and drug resistance mechanisms in HCV. Despite their varied roles, the application of in-silico approaches in HCV drug design is still in its infancy. A more mature application should aim at modelling the whole HCV replicon in its active form and help to identify new effective druggable sites within the replicon system. With more technological advancements, the roles of computer-aided methods are only going to increase several folds in the development of next-generation HCV drugs.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2017
29778797,Discovery of potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor flavonols: Insights into mechanism of action through inhibition kinetics and docking simulations.,"Beside other pharmaceutical benefits, flavonoids are known for their potent alpha-glucosidase inhibition. In the present study, we investigated alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects of structurally related 11 flavonols, among which quercetin-3-O-(3''-O-galloyl)-beta-galactopyranoside (8) and quercetin 3-O-(6''-O-galloyl)-beta-glucopyranoside (9) showed significant inhibition compared to the positive control, acarbose, with IC(50) values of 0.97 +/- 0.02 and 1.35 +/- 0.06 microM, respectively. It was found that while sugar substitution to C3-OH of C ring reduced the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect, galloyl substitution to these sugar units increased it. An enzyme kinetics analysis revealed that 7 was competitive, whereas 1, 2, 8, and 9 were uncompetitive inhibitors. In the light of these findings, we performed molecular docking studies to predict their inhibition mechanisms at atomic level.",Bioorganic chemistry,2018
36321808,Actives-Based Receptor Selection Strongly Increases the Success Rate in Structure-Based Drug Design and Leads to Identification of 22 Potent Cancer Inhibitors.,"Computer-aided drug design, an important component of the early stages of the drug discovery pipeline, routinely identifies large numbers of false positive hits that are subsequently confirmed to be experimentally inactive compounds. We have developed a methodology to improve true positive prediction rates in structure-based drug design and have successfully applied the protocol to twenty target systems and identified the top three performing conformers for each of the targets. Receptor performance was evaluated based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for two independent sets of known actives. For a subset of five diverse cancer-related disease targets, we validated our approach through experimental testing of the top 50 compounds from a blind screening of a small molecule library containing hundreds of thousands of compounds. Our methods of receptor and compound selection resulted in the identification of 22 novel inhibitors in the low muM-nM range, with the most potent being an EGFR inhibitor with an IC(50) value of 7.96 nM. Additionally, for a subset of five independent target systems, we demonstrated the utility of Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics to thoroughly explore a target system's potential energy surface and generate highly predictive receptor conformations.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022

METHOD: The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of the previously isolated thirty eight compounds were predicted using SwissADME web tool whereas OSIRIS Property Explorer was used for toxicity risk assessment and drug- likeliness. Twelve compounds were selected for docking on human alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylaseenzymes using Autodock 4.0 software. Furthermore, the active extract was in vivo tested for the antidiabetic activity and then identified usingTLC bioautographic method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Eriodictyol was found to have the highest potential as an inhibitor against alpha-amylase with binding energy of -9.92 kcal/mol. Rutin was the most potent against alpha-glucosidase with binding energy of-9.15 kcal/mol. A considerable number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were computed between the compounds and the enzymes thereby making them energetically favorable and suggesting inhibition of these two enzymes as a plausible molecular mechanism for their antidiabetic effect. CONCLUSION: These two flavonoids could therefore be used as potential leads for structure- based design of new effective hypoglycemic agents.",Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,2021

As the drug-like chemical space reaches into the billions of molecules, increasingly powerful computer systems are required to probe, as well as tackle, the software engineering challenges needed to adapt existing docking programs to use next-generation massively parallel processing systems. We demonstrate docking setup using the wrapper code approach to optimize the DOCK program for large-scale computation as well as docking analysis using variance and promiscuity as examples.

31586701,Critical evaluation of current Alzheimer's drug discovery (2018-19) & futuristic Alzheimer drug model approach.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease responsible for death of millions of people worldwide is a progressive clinical disorder which causes neurons to degenerate and ultimately die. It is one of the common causes of dementia wherein a person's incapability to independently think, behave and decline in social skills can be quoted as major symptoms. However the early signs include the simple non-clinical symptoms such as forgetting recent events and conversations. Onset of these symptoms leads to worsened conditions wherein the AD patient suffers severe memory impairment and eventually becomes unable to work out everyday tasks. Even though there is no complete cure for AD, rigorous research has been going on to reduce the progress of AD. Currently, a very few clinical drugs are prevailing for AD treatment. So this is the need of hour to design, develop and discovery of novel anti-AD drugs. The main factors for the cause of AD according to scientific research reveals structural changes in brain proteins such as beta amyloid, tau proteins into plaques and tangles respectively. The abnormal proteins distort the neurons. Despite the high potencies of the synthesized molecules; they could not get on the clinical tests up to human usage. In this review article, the recent research carried out with respect to inhibition of AChE, BuChE, NO, BACE1, MAOs, Abeta, H3R, DAPK, CSF1R, 5-HT4R, PDE, sigma(1)R and GSK-3beta is compiled and organized. The summary is focused mainly on cholinesterases, Abeta, BACE1 and MAOs classes of potential inhibitors. The review also covers structure activity relationship of most potent compounds of each class of inhibitors alongside redesign and remodeling of the most significant inhibitors in order to expect cutting edge inhibitory properties towards AD.

29195801,Discovery of potent and reversible MAO-B inhibitors as furanochalcones.,"A series of twelve furanochalcones (F1-F12) was synthesized and investigated for their human monoamine oxidase inhibitory activities. Among the series, compound (2E, 4E)-1-(furan-2-yl)-5-phenylpenta-2, 4-dien-1-one (F1), which was analyzed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showed potent and selective MAO-B inhibitory activity with an inhibition constant (K(i)) value of 0.0041 muM and selectivity index of (SI) 172.4, and exhibited competitive inhibition. Introduction of a cinnamyl group to the furanochalcone significantly increased the inhibitory activity. In the dilution-recovery experiments, the residual activities of MAO-A and MAO-B by F1 under the diluted condition fully recovered as compared with the undiluted condition, indicating F1 is a reversible inhibitor. The K(i) value of F1 is the lowest among the values of chalcone derivatives and furthermore lower than that (0.0079 muM) of the reversible MAO-B inhibitor, lazabemide, a marketed drug. Molecular docking study against hMAO-B provided the binding site interactions of the lead compound, including strong pi-pi stacking between the phenyl system and FAD nucleus.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2018
24666296,Discovery of butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors among derivatives of azaphenothiazines.,"The study presents the discovery of novel butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) inhibitors among derivatives of azaphenothiazines by application of in silico and in vitro screening methods. From an in-house library of compounds, 143 heterocyclic molecules derived from the azaphenothiazine scaffold were chosen for virtual screening. Based on results of the docking procedure, 15 compounds were identified as exhibiting the best fit for the two screening complexes (ligand - AChE and ligand - BuChE). Five compounds displayed moderate AChE and good BuChE inhibitory activity at screening concentrations of 10 microM. The IC50 values for active BuChE inhibitors were in the 11.8-122.2 nM range.

32178714,"The antischistosomal potential of GSK-J4, an H3K27 demethylase inhibitor: insights from molecular modeling, transcriptomics and in vitro assays.","BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis chemotherapy is largely based on praziquantel (PZQ). Although PZQ is very safe and tolerable, it does not prevent reinfection and emerging resistance is a primary concern. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of epigenetic machinery in Schistosoma mansoni may result in severe alterations in parasite development, leading to death. This new route for drug discovery in schistosomiasis has focused on classes of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) as epigenetic drug targets. Schistosoma histone demethylases also seem to be important in the transition of cercariae into schistosomula, as well as sexual differentiation in adult worms. METHODS: The Target-Pathogen database and molecular docking assays were used to prioritize the druggability of S. mansoni histone demethylases. The transcription profile of Smp_03400 was re-analyzed using available databases. The effect of GSK-J4 inhibitor in schistosomula and adult worms' motility/viability/oviposition was assessed by in vitro assays. Ultrastructural analysis was performed on adult worms exposed to GSK-J4 by scanning electron microscopy, while internal structures and muscle fiber integrity was investigated by confocal microscopy after Langeron's carmine or phalloidin staining. RESULTS: The present evaluation of the potential druggability of 14 annotated S. mansoni demethylase enzymes identified the S. mansoni ortholog of human KDM6A/UTX (Smp_034000) as the most suitable druggable target. In silico analysis and molecular modeling indicated the potential for cofactor displacement by the chemical probe GSK-J4. Our re-analysis of transcriptomic data revealed that Smp_034000 expression peaks at 24 h in newly transformed schistosomula and 5-week-old adult worms. Moreover, this gene was highly expressed in the testes of mature male worms compared to the rest of the parasite body. In in vitro schistosome cultures, treatment with GSK-J4 produced striking effects on schistosomula mortality and adult worm motility and mortality, as well as egg oviposition, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Unexpectedly, western blot assays did not demonstrate overall modulation of H3K27me3 levels in response to GSK-J4. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy revealed the loss of original features in muscle fibers and alterations in cell-cell contact following GSK-J4 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: GSK-J4 presents promising potential for antischistosomal control; however, the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation.",Parasites & vectors,2020
39710831,HDAC3_VS_assistant: cheminformatics-driven discovery of histone deacetylase 3 inhibitors.,"Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitors keep significant therapeutic promise for treating oncological, neurodegenerative, and inflammatory diseases. In this work, we developed robust QSAR regression models for HDAC3 inhibitory activity and acute toxicity (LD(50), intravenous administration in mice). A total of 1751 compounds were curated for HDAC3 activity, and 15,068 for toxicity. The models employed molecular descriptors such as Morgan fingerprints, MACCS-166 keys, and Klekota-Roth, PubChem fingerprints integrated with machine learning algorithms including random forest, gradient boosting regressor, and support vector machine. The HDAC3 QSAR models achieved Q(2)(test) values of up to 0.76 and RMSE values as low as 0.58, while toxicity models attained Q(2)(test) values of 0.63 and RMSE values down to 0.41, with applicability domain (AD) coverage exceeding 68%. Internal validation by fivefold cross-validation (Q(2)cv = 0.70 for HDAC3 and 0.60 for toxicity) and y-randomization confirmed model reliability. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was also used to explain the influence of modeling features on model prediction results. The most predictive QSAR models are integrated into the developed HDAC3_VS_assistant application, which is freely available at https://hdac3-vs-assistant-v2.streamlit.app/ . Virtual screening conducted using the HDAC3_VS_assistant web application allowed us to reveal a number of potential inhibitors, and the nature of their bonds with the active HDAC3 site was additionally investigated by molecular docking.",Molecular diversity,2025
32639159,AutoPH4: An Automated Method for Generating Pharmacophore Models from Protein Binding Pockets.,"Pharmacophore models are widely used in computational drug discovery (e.g., in the virtual screening of drug molecules) to capture essential information about interactions between ligands and a target protein. Generating pharmacophore models from protein structures is typically a manual process, but there has been growing interest in automated pharmacophore generation methods. Automation makes feasible the processing of large numbers of protein conformations, such as those generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and thus may help achieve the longstanding goal of incorporating protein flexibility into virtual screening workflows. Here, we present AutoPH4, a new automated method for generating pharmacophore models based on protein structures; we show that a virtual screening workflow incorporating AutoPH4 ranks compounds more accurately than any other pharmacophore-based virtual screening workflow for which results on a public benchmark have been reported. The strong performance of the virtual screening workflow indicates that the AutoPH4 component of the workflow generates high-quality pharmacophores, making AutoPH4 promising for use in future virtual screening workflows as well, such as ones that use conformations generated by MD simulations.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2020

Inspired by nonequilibrium statistical physics, these models can generate 3D molecular structures with specific properties or requirements crucial to drug discovery. Diffusion models were particularly successful at learning the complex probability distributions of 3D molecular geometries and their corresponding chemical and physical properties through forward and reverse diffusion processes. This review focuses on the technical implementation of diffusion models tailored for 3D molecular generation. It compares the performance, evaluation methods, and implementation details of various diffusion models used for molecular generation tasks. We cover strategies for atom and bond representation, architectures of reverse diffusion denoising networks, and challenges associated with generating stable 3D molecular structures. This review also explores the applications of diffusion models in de novo drug design and related areas of computational chemistry, such as structure-based drug design, including target-specific molecular generation, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. We also cover conditional generation on physical properties, conformation generation, and fragment-based drug design. By summarizing the state-of-the-art diffusion models for 3D molecular generation, this review sheds light on their role in advancing drug discovery and their current limitations.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024
29945503,Proposing drug fragments for dengue virus NS5 protein.,"Dengue fever is a febrile illness caused by Dengue Virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Among its proteome, the nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is the biggest and most conserved. It has a primer-independent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain at its C-Terminus. Zou et al. studied the biological relevance of the two conserved cavities (named A and B) within the NS5 proteins of dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile Virus (WNV) using mutagenesis and revertant analysis and found four mutations located at cavity B having effects on viral replication. They recommended Cavity B, but not Cavity A as a potential target for drugs against flavivirus RdRp. In this study, we virtually screened the MayBridge drug fragments dataset for potential small molecule binders of cavity B using both AutoDock Vina, the standard docking tool, and QuickVina 2, our previously developed tool. We selected 16 fragments that appeared in the top 100 docking results of each of the representative structures of NS5. Visual inspection suggests that they have reasonable binding poses. The 16 predicted fragments are plausible drug candidates and should be considered for further validation, optimization, and linking to come up with a suitable inhibitor of dengue virus.",Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,2018
37993985,Exploring natural products library to identify potential inhibitors targeting isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis.,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) causing tuberculosis (TB) infection is a leading source of illness and death in developing nations, and the emergence of drug-resistant TB remains a significant global threat and a challenge in treating the disease. Mutations in the inhA and katG genes are connected to the principal molecular mechanism of isoniazid (INH) resistance, and continuous treatment of INH for more than a decade led to the evolution of INH resistant-TB (inhR-TB). Structure-based drug discovery approaches on traditional natural compounds are the contemporary source to identify significant lead molecules. This work focuses on discovering effective small compounds from natural compound libraries and applying pharmacophore-based virtual screening to filter out the molecules. The best-identified hit complexes were used for molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) to observe their stability and compactness. A three-dimensional e-pharmacophore hypothesis and screening generated 62 hits based on phase fitness scores from the pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Molecular docking experiments in Maestro's GLIDE module indicated that ZINC000002383126 and ASN22022 may be potential inhibitors of inhA and katG (native, inhA mutants S94A, Y158A, Y158F and Y158S and D137S, Y229F, S315T, W321F, and R418L mutants of katG). In addition, MDS analysis indicated that the native and mutant docked complexes of inhA and katG had good stability and remained compact in the binding pocket of the targets. In vitro studies can further validate the compounds that can act as INH competitive inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
29953204,Biosensor-Based Active Ingredients Recognition System for Screening STAT3 Ligands from Medical Herbs.,"A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor-based active ingredients recognition system (SPR-AIRS) was developed, validated, and applied to screen signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) ligands. First, features of the screening system were investigated in four aspects: (1) specificity of the STAT3-immobilized chip, it shows that the chip could be applied to screen STAT3 ligands from complex mixture; (2) linearity and limit of detection (LOD) of the system, the minimum recovery cycle number was determined as 5 cycles; (3) saturability of the chip, the results indicate that it is necessary to select a proper concentration based on the compound's K(d) value; (4) robustness of the system, it indicates that inactive compounds in the matrix could not interfere with active compounds in the process of screening. Next, SPR-AIRS was applied to screen STAT3 ligands from medicinal herbs. Nine candidate compounds were fished out. Then SPR assay and molecular docking were performed to verify the interplay between STAT3 and candidate compounds. Apoptosis assay and luciferase report assay were performed to investigate the drug effect of candidate compounds on STAT3 activity. Western blot results indicated that neobaicalein and polydatin could inhibit the phosphorylation of STAT3. As far as we know, this is the first time that neobaicalein and polydatin are reported as effective STAT3 ligands.

29481075,Molecular-Simulation-Driven Fragment Screening for the Discovery of New CXCL12 Inhibitors.,"Fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has become a mainstream approach in drug design because it allows the reduction of the chemical space and screening libraries while identifying fragments with high protein-ligand efficiency interactions that can later be grown into drug-like leads. In this work, we leverage high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to screen a library of 129 fragments for a total of 5.85 ms against the CXCL12 monomer, a chemokine involved in inflammation and diseases such as cancer. Our in silico binding assay was able to recover binding poses, affinities, and kinetics for the selected library and was able to predict 8 mM-affinity fragments with ligand efficiencies higher than 0.3. All of the fragment hits present a similar chemical structure, with a hydrophobic core and a positively charged group, and bind to either sY7 or H1S68 pockets, where they share pharmacophoric properties with experimentally resolved natural binders.

36029004,Combined docking and machine learning identify key molecular determinants of ligand pharmacological activity on beta2 adrenoceptor.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are valuable therapeutic targets for many diseases. A central question of GPCR drug discovery is to understand what determines the agonism or antagonism of ligands that bind them. Ligands exert their action via the interactions in the ligand binding pocket. We hypothesized that there is a common set of receptor interactions made by ligands of diverse structures that mediate their action and that among a large dataset of different ligands, the functionally important interactions will be over-represented. We computationally docked ~2700 known beta2AR ligands to multiple beta2AR structures, generating ca 75 000 docking poses and predicted all atomic interactions between the receptor and the ligand. We used machine learning (ML) techniques to identify specific interactions that correlate with the agonist or antagonist activity of these ligands. We demonstrate with the application of ML methods that it is possible to identify the key interactions associated with agonism or antagonism of ligands. The most representative interactions for agonist ligands involve K97(2.68x67) , F194(ECL2) , S203(5.42x43) , S204(5.43x44) , S207(5.46x641) , H296(6.58x58) , and K305(7.32x31) . Meanwhile, the antagonist ligands made interactions with W286(6.48x48) and Y316(7.43x42) , both residues considered to be important in GPCR activation. The interpretation of ML analysis in human understandable form allowed us to construct an exquisitely detailed structure-activity relationship that identifies small changes to the ligands that invert their pharmacological activity and thus helps to guide the drug discovery process. This approach can be readily applied to any drug target.",Pharmacology research & perspectives,2022

However, the target affinity and synthesizability of the generated molecules present critical challenges for the successful application of AI technology. Therefore, we developed an advanced reinforcement learning model to bridge the gap between the theory of de novo molecular generation and the practical aspects of drug discovery. This model utilizes chemical reaction templates and commercially available building blocks as a starting point and employs forward reaction prediction to generate molecules, while real-time docking and drug-likeness predictions are conducted to ensure synthesizability and drug-likeness. We applied this model to design active molecules targeting the inflammation-related receptor CXCR4 and successfully prepared them according to the AI-proposed synthetic routes.

26573009,Macromolecular Modelling and Docking Simulations for the Discovery of Selective GPER Ligands.,"Estrogens influence multiple physiological processes and are implicated in many diseases as well. Cellular responses to estrogens are mainly mediated by the estrogen receptors (ER)alpha and ERbeta, which act as ligand-activated transcription factors. Recently, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, namely GPER/GPR30, has been identified as a further mediator of estrogen signalling in different pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. Today, computational methods are commonly used in all areas of health science research. Among these methods, virtual ligand screening has become an established technique for hit discovery and optimization. The absence of an established three-dimensional structure of GPER promoted studies of structure-based drug design in order to build reliable molecular models of this receptor. Here, we discuss the results obtained through the structure-based virtual ligand screening for GPER, which allowed the identification and synthesis of different selective agonist and antagonist moieties. These compounds led significant advances in our understanding of the GPER function at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. In particular, selective GPER ligands were critical toward the evaluation of the role elicited by this receptor in several pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. Considering that structure-based approaches are fundamental in drug discovery, future research breakthroughs with the aid of computer-aided molecular design and chemo-bioinformatics could generate a new class of drugs that, acting through GPER, would be useful in a variety of diseases as well as in innovative anticancer strategies.",The AAPS journal,2016

In this study, we put forward a ligand-based pharmacophore for the first time, which was generated by a set of multiple chemical scaffolds including sulfonamide and non-sulfonamide derivatives and consisted of four chemical features: an aromatic ring, a hydrophobic group and two hydrogen acceptors. The active cavity was divided into three regions according to the properties of the amino acids surrounded and was used for the docking of 16 known active inhibitors. Four accurate docking methods were employed to analyze the ligand-protein interactions in our molecular simulation study. Combining pharmacophore model with docking results, an interaction model was obtained with four features that were consistent with one another, which was more powerful in illuminating the binding site. The research elucidated a valuable relationship between structure and activity, at the same time it proposed an accurate binding model that was instructive in the development of novel and potent Nav1.7 inhibitors in the future.",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2018
26959013,Computational Study on New Natural Compound Inhibitors of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinases.,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) are key enzymes in glucose metabolism, negatively regulating pyruvate dehyrogenase complex (PDC) activity through phosphorylation. Inhibiting PDKs could upregulate PDC activity and drive cells into more aerobic metabolism. Therefore, PDKs are potential targets for metabolism related diseases, such as cancers and diabetes. In this study, a series of computer-aided virtual screening techniques were utilized to discover potential inhibitors of PDKs. Structure-based screening using Libdock was carried out following by ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and toxicity prediction. Molecular docking was used to analyze the binding mechanism between these compounds and PDKs. Molecular dynamic simulation was utilized to confirm the stability of potential compound binding. From the computational results, two novel natural coumarins compounds (ZINC12296427 and ZINC12389251) from the ZINC database were found binding to PDKs with favorable interaction energy and predicted to be non-toxic.

37340697,Identification of potential biogenic chalcones against antibiotic resistant efflux pump (AcrB) via computational study.,"The cases of bacterial multidrug resistance are increasing every year and becoming a serious concern for human health. Multidrug efflux pumps are key players in the formation of antibiotic resistance, which transfer out a broad spectrum of drugs from the cell and convey resistance to the host. Efflux pumps have significantly reduced the efficacy of the previously available antibiotic armory, thereby increasing the frequency of therapeutic failures. In gram-negative bacteria, the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is the principal transporter of the substrate and plays a major role in the formation of antibiotic resistance. In the current work, advanced computer-aided drug discovery approaches were utilized to find hit molecules from the library of biogenic chalcones against the bacterial AcrB efflux pump. The results of the performed computational studies via molecular docking, drug-likeness prediction, pharmacokinetic profiling, pharmacophore mapping, density functional theory, and molecular dynamics simulation study provided ZINC000004695648, ZINC000014762506, ZINC000014762510, ZINC000095099506, and ZINC000085510993 as stable hit molecules against the AcrB efflux pumps.

SBVS requires a very limited experimental effort and is particularly well suited for academic labs and small biotech companies that, unlike pharmaceutical companies, do not have physical access to quality small-molecule libraries. Here, we describe SBVS of commercial compound libraries for Mer kinase inhibitors. The screening protocol relies on the docking algorithm Glide complemented by a post-docking filter based on structural protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (SPLIF).","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2016
38636391,Structural simulation and selective inhibitor discovery study for histone demethylases KDM4E/6B from a computational perspective.,"The methylation and demethylation of lysine and arginine side chains are fundamental processes in gene regulation and disease development. Histone lysine methylation, controlled by histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in diseases such as cancer and aging. This study focuses on two members of the lysine demethylase (KDM) family, KDM4E and KDM6B, which are significant in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis. KDM4E demonstrates selectivity for gene regulation, particularly concerning cancer, while KDM6B is implicated in inflammation and cancer. The study utilizes specific inhibitors, DA-24905 and GSK-J1, showcasing their exceptional selectivity for KDM4E and KDM6B, respectively. Employing an array of computational simulations, including sequence alignment, molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and free energy calculations, we conclude that although the binding cavities of KDM4E and KDM6B has high similarity, there are still some different crucial amino acid residues, indicating diverse binding forms between protein and ligands. Various interaction predominates when proteins are bound to different ligands, which also has significant effect on selective inhibition. These findings provide insights into potential therapeutic strategies for diseases by selectively targeting these KDM members.",Computational biology and chemistry,2024

33825834,Remodelling structure-based drug design using machine learning.,"To keep up with the pace of rapid discoveries in biomedicine, a plethora of research endeavors had been directed toward Rational Drug Development that slowly gave way to Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD). In the past few decades, SBDD played a stupendous role in identification of novel drug-like molecules that are capable of altering the structures and/or functions of the target macromolecules involved in different disease pathways and networks. Unfortunately, post-delivery drug failures due to adverse drug interactions have constrained the use of SBDD in biomedical applications. However, recent technological advancements, along with parallel surge in clinical research have led to the concomitant establishment of other powerful computational techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These leading-edge tools with the ability to successfully predict side-effects of a wide range of drugs have eventually taken over the field of drug design. ML, a subset of AI, is a robust computational tool that is capable of data analysis and analytical model building with minimal human intervention. It is based on powerful algorithms that use huge sets of 'training data' as inputs to predict new output values, which improve iteratively through experience. In this review, along with a brief discussion on the evolution of the drug discovery process, we have focused on the methodologies pertaining to the technological advancements of machine learning. This review, with specific examples, also emphasises the tremendous contributions of ML in the field of biomedicine, while exploring possibilities for future developments.",Emerging topics in life sciences,2021

Although the disease affects approximately 260 million people, the treatment relies exclusively on praziquantel, a drug discovered in the mid-1970s that lacks efficacy against the larval stages of the parasite. In addition, the dependence on a single treatment has raised concerns about drug resistance, and reduced susceptibility has already been found in laboratory and field isolates. Therefore, novel therapies for schistosomiasis are needed, and several approaches have been used to that end. One of these strategies, molecular modeling, has been increasingly integrated with experimental techniques, resulting in the discovery of novel antischistosomal agents.",Trends in parasitology,2016

38728062,PharmaCore: The Automatic Generation of 3D Structure-Based Pharmacophore Models from Protein/Ligand Complexes.,"In this work, we present PharmaCore: a new, completely automatic workflow aimed at generating three-dimensional (3D) structure-based pharmacophore models toward any target of interest. The proposed approach relies on using cocrystallized ligands to create the input files for generating the pharmacophore hypotheses, integrating not only the three-dimensional structural information on the ligand but also data concerning the binding mode of these molecules put in the protein cavity. We developed a Python library that, starting from the specific UniProt ID of the protein under investigation as the only element that requires user intervention, subsequently collects and aligns the corresponding structures bearing a known ligand in a fully automated fashion, bringing them all into the same coordinate system. The protocol includes a final phase in which the aligned small molecules are used to produce the pharmacophore hypotheses directly onto the protein structure using a specific software, e.g., Phase (Schrodinger LLC). To validate the entire procedure and highlight the possible applications in the field of drug discovery and repositioning, we first generated pharmacophores for soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and compared with already-published ones. Then, we reproduced the binding profile of a reported selective binder of ATAD2 bromodomain (AM879), testing it against a panel of 1741 pharmacophores related to 16 epigenetic proteins and automatically generated with PharmaCore, finally disclosing putative unprecedented off-targets. The computational predictions were successfully validated with AlphaScreen assays, highlighting the applicability of the proposed workflow in drug discovery and repositioning.

The current therapeutic options for B. microti are limited, and drug resistance is a concern. This study proposes using computational drug design approaches to find and design an effective drug against B. microti. The study investigated the potentiality of nine natural compounds against the pathogenic human B. microti parasite and identified Vasicinone and Evodiamine as the most promising drugs. The ligand structures were optimized using density functional theory, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics such as HOMO-LUMO, drug-likeness and theoretical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET), and pharmacokinetics characteristics performed. The results showed that Vasicinone (-8.6 kcal/mol and -7.8 kcal/mol) and Evodiamine (-8.7 kcal/mol and -8.5 kcal/mol) had the highest binding energy and anti-parasitic activity against B. microti lactate dehydrogenase and B. microti lactate dehydrogenase apo form. The strongest binding energy was reported by Vasicinone and Evodiamine; the compounds were evaluated through molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns, and their stability when they form complexes with the targeted receptors was determined. Finally, the pkCSM web server is employed to predict the ADMET qualities of specific molecules, which can help prevent negative effects that arise from taking the treatment. The SwissADME web server is used to assess the Lipinski rule of five and drug-likeness properties including topological polar surface area and bioavailability. The Lipinski rule is used to estimate significant drug-likeness. The theoretical pharmacokinetics analysis and drug-likeness of the selected compounds are confirmed to be accepted by the Lipinski rule and have better ADMET features. Thus, to confirm their experimental value, these mentioned molecules should be suggested to carry out in wet lab, pre-clinical, and clinical levels.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023
26250822,GeauxDock: A novel approach for mixed-resolution ligand docking using a descriptor-based force field.,"Molecular docking is an important component of computer-aided drug discovery. In this communication, we describe GeauxDock, a new docking approach that builds on the ideas of ligand homology modeling. GeauxDock features a descriptor-based scoring function integrating evolutionary constraints with physics-based energy terms, a mixed-resolution molecular representation of protein-ligand complexes, and an efficient Monte Carlo sampling protocol. To drive docking simulations toward experimental conformations, the scoring function was carefully optimized to produce a correlation between the total pseudoenergy and the native-likeness of binding poses. Indeed, benchmarking calculations demonstrate that GeauxDock has a strong capacity to identify near-native conformations across docking trajectories with the area under receiver operating characteristics of 0.85. By excluding closely related templates, we show that GeauxDock maintains its accuracy at lower levels of homology through the increased contribution from physics-based energy terms compensating for weak evolutionary constraints.

A rational strategy, combiphore approach, derived from the combined study of Structure and Ligand based pharmacophore has been described to identify novel GPR40 modulators. METHODS: DISCOtech module from Discovery studio was used for the generation of the Structure and Ligand based pharmacophore models which gave hydrophobic aromatic, ring aromatic and negative ionizable as essential pharmacophoric features. The generated models were validated by screening active and inactive datasets, GH scoring and ROC curve analysis. The best model was exposed as a 3D query to screen the hits from databases like GLASS (GPCR-Ligand Association), GPCR SARfari and Mini-Maybridge. Various filters were applied to retrieve the hit molecules having good drug-like properties. A known protein structure of hGPR40 (pdb: 4PHU) having TAK-875 as ligand complex was used to perform the molecular docking studies; using SYBYL-X 1.2 software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Clustering both the models gave RMSD of 0.89. Therefore, the present approach explored the maximum features by combining both ligand and structure based pharmacophore models. A common structural motif as identified in combiphore for GPR40 modulation consists of the para-substituted phenyl propionic acid scaffold. Therefore, the combiphore approach, whereby maximum structural information (from both ligand and biological protein) is explored, gives maximum insights into the plausible protein-ligand interactions and provides potential lead candidates as exemplified in this study.",Current drug discovery technologies,2020
28032980,Ligand Discovery for a Peptide-Binding GPCR by Structure-Based Screening of Fragment- and Lead-Like Chemical Libraries.,"Peptide-recognizing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are promising therapeutic targets but often resist drug discovery efforts. Determination of crystal structures for peptide-binding GPCRs has provided opportunities to explore structure-based methods in lead development. Molecular docking screens of two chemical libraries, containing either fragment- or lead-like compounds, against a neurotensin receptor 1 crystal structure allowed for a comparison between different drug development strategies for peptide-binding GPCRs. A total of 2.3 million molecules were screened computationally, and 25 fragments and 27 leads that were top-ranked in each library were selected for experimental evaluation. Of these, eight fragments and five leads were confirmed as ligands by surface plasmon resonance. The hit rate for the fragment screen (32%) was thus higher than for the lead-like library (19%), but the affinities of the fragments were  approximately 100-fold lower. Both screens returned unique scaffolds and demonstrated that a crystal structure of a stabilized peptide-binding GPCR can guide the discovery of small-molecule agonists. The complementary advantages of exploring fragment- and lead-like chemical space suggest that these strategies should be applied synergistically in structure-based screens against challenging GPCR targets.",ACS chemical biology,2017

35807415,Application of Mathematical Modeling and Computational Tools in the Modern Drug Design and Development Process.,"The conventional drug discovery approach is an expensive and time-consuming process, but its limitations have been overcome with the help of mathematical modeling and computational drug design approaches. Previously, finding a small molecular candidate as a drug against a disease was very costly and required a long time to screen a compound against a specific target. The development of novel targets and small molecular candidates against different diseases including emerging and reemerging diseases remains a major concern and necessitates the development of novel therapeutic targets as well as drug candidates as early as possible. In this regard, computational and mathematical modeling approaches for drug development are advantageous due to their fastest predictive ability and cost-effectiveness features. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) techniques utilize different computer programs as well as mathematics formulas to comprehend the interaction of a target and drugs. Traditional methods to determine small-molecule candidates as a drug have several limitations, but CADD utilizes novel methods that require little time and accurately predict a compound against a specific disease with minimal cost. Therefore, this review aims to provide a brief insight into the mathematical modeling and computational approaches for identifying a novel target and small molecular candidates for curing a specific disease. The comprehensive review mainly focuses on biological target prediction, structure-based and ligand-based drug design methods, molecular docking, virtual screening, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-GBSA/MM-PBSA approaches along with valuable database resources and tools for identifying novel targets and therapeutics against a disease.

This is also a global concern due to the zoonosis of these parasites, as they infect both humans and animals. Therefore, we need not only to create novel antibiotics, but also to speed up the development pipeline for these antibiotics. This may be achieved by using novel drug targets for Kinetoplastids drug discovery. In this study, we focused our attention on motifs of rRNA molecules that have been created using homology modeling. The RNA is the most ambiguous biopolymer in the kinetoplatid, which carries many different functions. For instance, tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs are essential for gene expression both in the pro-and eukaryotes. However, all these types of RNAs have sequences with unique 3D structures that are specific for kinetoplastids only and can be used to shut down essential biochemical processes in kinetoplastids only. All these features make RNA very potent targets for antibacterial drug development. Here, we combine in silico methods combined with both computational biology and structure prediction tools to address our hypothesis. In this study, we outline a systematic approach for identifying kinetoplastid rRNA-ligand interactions and, more specifically, techniques that can be used to identify small molecules that target particular RNA. The high-resolution optimized model structures of these kineoplastids were generated using RNA 123, where all the stereochemical conflicts were solved and energies minimized to attain the best biological qualities. The high-resolution optimized model's structures of these kinetoplastids were generated using RNA 123 where all the stereochemical conflicts were solved and energies minimized to attain the best biological qualities.

We demonstrate a sensible exploitation of virtual screening strategies to 18S rRNA using natural products interfaced with classical maximization of their efficacy in phamacognosy strategies that are well established. Integration of these virtual screening strategies in natural products chemistry and biochemistry research will spur the development of potential interventions to these tropical neglected diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021

Our screening protocol comprises two filtering steps. The first filter is based on the shape and chemical similarity to known plant-derived repellents, whereas the second filter is based on the predicted similarity of the ligand's binding mode to the Anopheles gambiae odorant binding protein (AgamOBP1) relative to that of DEET and Icaridin to the same OBP. Using this protocol, a chemical library containing 42,755 synthetic molecules was screened in silico and sixteen selected compounds were tested for their affinity to AgamOBP1 in vitro and repellence against A. gambiae female mosquitoes using a warm-body repellent assay.

Herein, we report the synthesis and preliminary SAR studies on substituted 6-hydroxyindole-7-carboxylates as a tunable framework for COX inhibition and anti-cancer activity. To facilitate the SAR discovery, a modular synthetic methodology was employed which enabled the synthesis of the substituted indoles. From the synthesized compounds, five displayed COX-1 inhibition activity in a colorimetric assay with their intracellular activity further confirmed by a cell-based target validation assay. Following molecular docking analyses, key interactions between the active compounds and the COX enzymes were elucidated.

The mechanism of cell death was investigated and found to include induction of Caspase-3 activation and cleavage, down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and upregulation of Bax. Finally, two representative compounds were confirmed to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1/G0 stage.

34065854,An Integrated Approach toward NanoBRET Tracers for Analysis of GPCR Ligand Engagement.,"Gaining insight into the pharmacology of ligand engagement with G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) under biologically relevant conditions is vital to both drug discovery and basic research. NanoLuc-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) monitoring competitive binding between fluorescent tracers and unmodified test compounds has emerged as a robust and sensitive method to quantify ligand engagement with specific GPCRs genetically fused to NanoLuc luciferase or the luminogenic HiBiT peptide. However, development of fluorescent tracers is often challenging and remains the principal bottleneck for this approach. One way to alleviate the burden of developing a specific tracer for each receptor is using promiscuous tracers, which is made possible by the intrinsic specificity of BRET. Here, we devised an integrated tracer discovery workflow that couples machine learning-guided in silico screening for scaffolds displaying promiscuous binding to GPCRs with a blend of synthetic strategies to rapidly generate multiple tracer candidates. Subsequently, these candidates were evaluated for binding in a NanoBRET ligand-engagement screen across a library of HiBiT-tagged GPCRs. Employing this workflow, we generated several promiscuous fluorescent tracers that can effectively engage multiple GPCRs, demonstrating the efficiency of this approach. We believe that this workflow has the potential to accelerate discovery of NanoBRET fluorescent tracers for GPCRs and other target classes.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021

BACKGROUND: With global aging, osteoporosis has become a common problem threatening the health of the elderly. It is of important clinical value to explore new targets for drug intervention and develop promising drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: To understand the major molecules that mediate the communication between the cell populations of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis patients and identify potential reusable drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of BM-MSCs in GSE147287 dataset were classified using the Seurat package. CellChat was devoted to analyzing the ligand-receptor pairs (LR pairs) contributing to the communication between BM-MSCs subsets. The LR pairs that were differentially expressed between osteoporosis samples and control samples and significantly correlated with immune score were screened in the GSE35959 dataset, and the differentially expressed gene in both GSE35959 and GSE13850 data sets were identified as targets from a single ligand or receptor. The therapeutic drugs for osteoporosis were screened by network proximity method, and the top-ranked drugs were selected for molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation with the target targets. RESULTS: Twelve subsets of BM-MSCs were identified, of which CD45-BM-MSCS_4, CD45-BM- MSCS_5, and CD45+ BM-MSCs_5 subsets showed significantly different distributions between osteoporosis samples and osteoarthritis samples. Six LR pairs were identified in the bidirectional communication between these three BM-MSCs subsets and other BM-MSCs subsets. Among them, MIF-CD74 and ITGB2-ICAM2 were significantly correlated with the immune score. CD74 was identified as the target, and a total of 48 drugs targeting CD47 protein were identified. Among them, DB01940 had the lowest free energy binding score with CD74 protein and the binding state was very stable. CONCLUSION: This study provided a new network-based framework for drug reuse and identified initial insights into therapeutic agents targeting CD74 in osteoporosis, which may be meaningful for promoting the development of osteoporosis treatment.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024

Therefore, this study proposes a novel and high-accuracy meta-model, namely MetaCGRP, that can precisely identify CGRP inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, MetaCGRP is the first SMILES-based approach that has been developed to identify CGRP inhibitors without the use of 3D structural information. In brief, we initially employed different molecular representation methods coupled with popular ML algorithms to construct a pool of baseline models. Then, all baseline models were optimized and used to generate multi-view features. Finally, we employed the feature selection method to optimize the multi-view features and determine the best feature subset to enable the construction of the meta-model. Both cross-validation and independent tests indicated that MetaCGRP clearly outperforms several conventional ML classifiers, with accuracies of 0.898 and 0.799 on the training and independent test datasets, respectively. In addition, MetaCGRP in conjunction with molecular docking was utilized to identify five potential natural product candidates from Thai herbal pharmacopoeia and analyze their binding affinity and interactions to CGRP. To facilitate community-wide efforts in expediting the discovery of novel CGRP inhibitors, a user-friendly web server for MetaCGRP is freely available at https://pmlabqsar.pythonanywhere.com/MetaCGRP .",Scientific reports,2024
34010501,Computational Approaches to Discover Novel Natural Compounds for SARS-CoV-2 Therapeutics.,"Scientists all over the world are facing a challenging task of finding effective therapeutics for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). One of the fastest ways of finding putative drug candidates is the use of computational drug discovery approaches. The purpose of the current study is to retrieve natural compounds that have obeyed to drug-like properties as potential inhibitors. Computational molecular modelling techniques were employed to discover compounds with potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibition properties. Accordingly, the InterBioScreen (IBS) database was obtained and was prepared by minimizing the compounds. To the resultant compounds, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and Lipinski's Rule of Five was applied to yield drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation studies to evaluate their stabilities. In the current article, we have employed the docking based virtual screening method using InterBioScreen (IBS) natural compound database yielding two compounds has potential hits. These compounds have demonstrated higher binding affinity scores than the reference compound together with good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, the identified hits have displayed stable interaction results inferred by molecular dynamics simulation results.

37232453,Machine learning-based drug design for identification of thymidylate kinase inhibitors as a potential anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"The rise of antibiotic-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has reduced the availability of medications for tuberculosis therapy, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality globally. Tuberculosis spreads from the lungs to other parts of the body, including the brain and spine. Developing a single drug can take several decades, making drug discovery costly and time-consuming. Machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF) and Gaussian naive base (GNB) are fast and effective and are commonly used in drug discovery. These algorithms are ideal for the virtual screening of large compound libraries to classify molecules as active or inactive. For the training of the models, a dataset of 307 was downloaded from BindingDB. Among 307 compounds, 85 compounds were labeled as active, having an IC50 below 58 mM, while 222 compounds were labeled inactive against thymidylate kinase, with 87.2% accuracy. The developed models were subjected to an external ZINC dataset of 136,564 compounds. Furthermore, we performed the 100-ns dynamic simulation and post trajectories analysis of compounds having good interaction and score in molecular docking. As compared to the standard reference compound, the top three hits revealed greater stability and compactness. In conclusion, our predicted hits can inhibit thymidylate kinase overexpression to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Thus, scientists around the globe are working to find potent drugs and designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19. Phytochemicals from medicinal plants are known to have a long history for the treatment of various pathogens and infections; thus, keeping this in mind, this study was performed to explore the potential of different phytochemicals as candidate inhibitors of the HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by using computer-aided drug discovery methods. Initially, the pharmacological assessment was performed to study the drug-likeness properties of the phytochemicals for their safe human administration. Suitable compounds were subjected to molecular docking to screen strongly binding phytochemicals with HR1 while the stability of ligand binding was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum computation-based density functional theory (DFT) analysis was constituted to analyze the reactivity of these compounds with the receptor. Through analysis, 108 phytochemicals passed the pharmacological assessment and upon docking of these 108 phytochemicals, 36 were screened passing a threshold of -8.5 kcal/mol. After analyzing stability and reactivity, 5 phytochemicals, i.e., SilybinC, Isopomiferin, Lycopene, SilydianinB, and Silydianin are identified as novel and potent candidates for the inhibition of HR1 domain in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

25336501,LIGSIFT: an open-source tool for ligand structural alignment and virtual screening.,"MOTIVATION: Shape-based alignment of small molecules is a widely used approach in computer-aided drug discovery. Most shape-based ligand structure alignment applications, both commercial and freely available ones, use the Tanimoto coefficient or similar functions for evaluating molecular similarity. Major drawbacks of using such functions are the size dependence of the score and the fact that the statistical significance of the molecular match using such metrics is not reported. RESULTS: We describe a new open-source ligand structure alignment and virtual screening (VS) algorithm, LIGSIFT, that uses Gaussian molecular shape overlay for fast small molecule alignment and a size-independent scoring function for efficient VS based on the statistical significance of the score. LIGSIFT was tested against the compounds for 40 protein targets available in the Directory of Useful Decoys and the performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the Enrichment Factor (EF) and Hit Rate (HR). LIGSIFT-based VS shows an average AUC of 0.79, average EF values of 20.8 and a HR of 59% in the top 1% of the screened library.

32303174,Discovery of Novel Compounds Targeting DJ-1 as Neuroprotectants for Parkinson's Disease by Virtual Screening and In Silico Method.,"AIM: To screen the zinc database for structurally similar molecules to compound 23 that targets DJ1 for use as a neuroprotective agent for Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. To date, several proteins account for the recessive familial PD-forms, namely, Parkin, PINK-1, DJ-1, SNCA, PARK2, and LRRK2 Genes. DJ1 is one of the important central points that may be targeted for PD therapy. Recently, Compound 23 has been observed to exert the neuroprotective effect against neurodegeneration in a PD model, but due to its toxic substructure, the hunt for better nontoxic compounds continues. OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of our work is to apply in silico approaches to screen structure similar compounds that interact potentially with DJ1 and may serve as a good therapeutic molecule for PD. METHODS: Initial data mining was done from the zinc database and then screened compounds were additionally screened with toxicity checker, carcinopred, ADMET analysis and docking analysis. RESULTS: The basic screening of database for structurally similar chemicals to compound 23 resulted in 50 compounds, which were further screened to twenty-three and finally seven compounds have been screened based on the toxicity and carcinopred test. Later, the seven compounds were docked and analysed for docking efficiency with DJ1. Our result of molecular docking and molecular simulation analysis highlights Molecule 42(SS2) to exhibit best binding affinity against DJ-1 protein target and can be proposed to be used as a therapeutic agent to modulate neurodegenerative proteins. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we conclude the discovery of novel, non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, ADMET investigated, capable of crossing BB barrier but structurally similar compounds to Compound-23, specifically molecule 42(SS2) and potentially molecule 34(SS1) to be used as neuroprotective agents for Parkinson's disease.",Current computer-aided drug design,2021

31263275,CB-Dock: a web server for cavity detection-guided protein-ligand blind docking.,"As the number of elucidated protein structures is rapidly increasing, the growing data call for methods to efficiently exploit the structural information for biological and pharmaceutical purposes. Given the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein and a ligand, predicting their binding sites and affinity are a key task for computer-aided drug discovery. To address this task, a variety of docking tools have been developed. Most of them focus on docking in the preset binding sites given by users. To automatically predict binding modes without information about binding sites, we developed a user-friendly blind docking web server, named CB-Dock, which predicts binding sites of a given protein and calculates the centers and sizes with a novel curvature-based cavity detection approach, and performs docking with a popular docking program, Autodock Vina. This method was carefully optimized and achieved ~70% success rate for the top-ranking poses whose root mean square deviation (RMSD) were within 2 A from the X-ray pose, which outperformed the state-of-the-art blind docking tools in our benchmark tests.

38630855,Evaluation of AlphaFold2 Structures for Hit Identification across Multiple Scenarios.,"The introduction of AlphaFold2 (AF2) has sparked significant enthusiasm and generated extensive discussion within the scientific community, particularly among drug discovery researchers. Although previous studies have addressed the performance of AF2 structures in virtual screening (VS), a more comprehensive investigation is still necessary considering the paramount importance of structural accuracy in drug design. In this study, we evaluate the performance of AF2 structures in VS across three common drug discovery scenarios: targets with holo, apo, and AF2 structures; targets with only apo and AF2 structures; and targets exclusively with AF2 structures. We utilized both the traditional physics-based Glide and the deep-learning-based scoring function RTMscore to rank the compounds in the DUD-E, DEKOIS 2.0, and DECOY data sets. The results demonstrate that, overall, the performance of VS on AF2 structures is comparable to that on apo structures but notably inferior to that on holo structures across diverse scenarios. Moreover, when a target has solely AF2 structure, selecting the holo structure of the target from different subtypes within the same protein family produces comparable results with the AF2 structure for VS on the data set of the AF2 structures, and significantly better results than the AF2 structures on its own data set. This indicates that utilizing AF2 structures for docking-based VS may not yield most satisfactory outcomes, even when solely AF2 structures are available. Moreover, we rule out the possibility that the variations in VS performance between the binding pockets of AF2 and holo structures arise from the differences in their biological assembly composition.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024
37280244,An interaction-based drug discovery screen explains known SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and predicts new compound scaffolds.,"The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown the necessity for fast and broad drug discovery methods to enable us to react quickly to novel and highly infectious diseases. A well-known SARS-CoV-2 target is the viral main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (M(pro)), known to control coronavirus replication, which is essential for the viral life cycle. Here, we applied an interaction-based drug repositioning algorithm on all protein-compound complexes available in the protein database (PDB) to identify M(pro) inhibitors and potential novel compound scaffolds against SARS-CoV-2. The screen revealed a heterogeneous set of 692 potential M(pro) inhibitors containing known ones such as Dasatinib, Amodiaquine, and Flavin mononucleotide, as well as so far untested chemical scaffolds. In a follow-up evaluation, we used publicly available data published almost two years after the screen to validate our results. In total, we are able to validate 17% of the top 100 predictions with publicly available data and can furthermore show that predicted compounds do cover scaffolds that are yet not associated with M(pro). Finally, we detected a potentially important binding pattern consisting of 3 hydrogen bonds with hydrogen donors of an oxyanion hole within the active side of M(pro). Overall, these results give hope that we will be better prepared for future pandemics and that drug development will become more efficient in the upcoming years.",Scientific reports,2023

35011410,Evaluation of Virtual Screening Strategies for the Identification of gamma-Secretase Inhibitors and Modulators.,"gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that is important in regulating normal cell physiology via cleavage of over 100 transmembrane proteins, including Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Notch family receptors. However, aberrant proteolysis of substrates has implications in the progression of disease pathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), cancers, and skin disorders. While several gamma-secretase inhibitors have been identified, there has been toxicity observed in clinical trials associated with non-selective enzyme inhibition. To address this, gamma-secretase modulators have been identified and pursued as more selective agents. Recent structural evidence has provided an insight into how gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators are recognized by gamma-secretase, providing a platform for rational drug design targeting this protease. In this study, docking- and pharmacophore-based screening approaches were evaluated for their ability to identify, from libraries of known inhibitors and modulators with decoys with similar physicochemical properties, gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators. Using these libraries, we defined strategies for identifying both gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators incorporating an initial pharmacophore-based screen followed by a docking-based screen, with each strategy employing distinct gamma-secretase structures. Furthermore, known gamma-secretase inhibitors and modulators were able to be identified from an external set of bioactive molecules following application of the derived screening strategies. The approaches described herein will inform the discovery of novel small molecules targeting gamma-secretase.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
27966721,Integrated discovery of FOXO1-DNA stabilizers from marine natural products to restore chemosensitivity to anti-EGFR-based therapy for metastatic lung cancer.,"The transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) negatively regulates activated EGFR signaling by turning on the gene expression of tumor suppressor Kruppel-like factor 6. Here, we propose that the chemosensitivity to anti-EGFR-based lung cancer therapy can be restored by stabilization of the FOXO1-DNA complex architecture using small-molecule marine natural medicines. A synthetic protocol that integrates computational ligand-protein-DNA binding analysis and an experimental fluorescence binding assay was applied against a large library of structurally diverse, drug-like marine natural products to discover novel stabilizers of DNA-bound FOXO1 conformation. The screening utilized chemical similarity analysis to exclude structurally redundant compounds, and then carried out high-throughput molecular docking and computational binding analysis to identify potential marine natural product candidates. Consequently, eight commercially available hits were selected and tested in vitro, from which four marine natural product compounds (tanzawaic acid D, hymenidin, cribrostatin 6 and barbamide) were found to have high or moderate potency to selectively bind to the FOXO1 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in the presence of its cognate DNA partner. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the identified stabilizers do not directly interact with DNA; instead, they can effectively stabilize the free FOXO1 DBD domain in the DNA-bound conformation and thus promote the binding of FOXO1 to DNA.",Molecular bioSystems,2017
32452282,Fragment tailoring strategy to design novel chemical entities as potential binders of novel corona virus main protease.,"The recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) has put the world on serious alert. The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro)) cleaves the long polyprotein chains to release functional proteins required for replication of the virus and thus is a potential drug target to design new chemical entities in order to inhibit the viral replication in human cells. The current study employs state of art computational methods to design novel molecules by linking molecular fragments which specifically bind to different constituent sub-pockets of the SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro) binding site. A huge library of 191678 fragments was screened against the binding cavity of SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro) and high affinity fragments binding to adjacent sub-pockets were tailored to generate new molecules. These newly formed molecules were further subjected to molecular docking, ADMET filters and MM-GBSA binding energy calculations to select 17 best molecules (named as MP-In1 to MP-In17), which showed comparable binding affinities and interactions with the key binding site residues as the reference ligand. The complexes of these 17 molecules and the reference molecule with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro), were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, which assessed the stabilities of their binding with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro). Fifteen molecules were found to form stable complexes with SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro). These novel chemical entities designed specifically according to the pharmacophoric requirements of SARS-CoV-2-M(Pro) binding pockets showed good synthetic feasibility and returned no exact match when searched against chemical databases.

It is a chronic metabolic disease that involves multiple enzymes such as alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidases. Inhibition of these enzymes has been identified as a promising method for managing diabetes, and researchers are currently focusing on discovering novel alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors for diabetes therapy. Hence, we have selected 12 bioactive compounds from the Momordica charantia (MC) plant and performed a virtual screening and molecular dynamics investigation to identify natural inhibitors of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidases. Our in silico result revealed that phytocompound Rutin showed the highest binding affinity against alpha-amylase (1HNY) enzymes at (-11.68 kcal/mol), followed by Karaviloside II (-9.39), Momordicoside F (-9.19), Campesterol (-9.11.

The clinical and epidemiological data have shown that several cancerous risk factors are strongly linked to Female Infertility (FI) development, but the exact causes remain unknown. Understanding how these risk factors affect FI-affected cell pathways might pave the door for the discovery of critical signaling pathways and hub proteins that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention. To deal with this, we have used a bioinformatics pipeline to build a transcriptome study of FI with four carcinogenic risk factors: Endometrial Cancer (EC), Ovarian Cancer (OC), Cervical Cancer (CC), and Thyroid Cancer (TC). We identified FI sharing 97, 211, 87 and 33 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with EC, OC, CC, and TC, respectively. We have built gene-disease association networks from the identified genes based on the multilayer network and neighbour-based benchmarking. Identified TNF signalling pathways, ovarian infertility genes, cholesterol metabolic process, and cellular response to cytokine stimulus were significant molecular and GO pathways, both of which improved our understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms of cancers associated with FI progression. For therapeutic intervention, we have targeted the two most significant hub proteins VEGFA and PIK3R1, out of ten proteins based on Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) value of cytoscape and literature analysis for molecular docking with 27 phytoestrogenic compounds. Among them, sesamin, galangin and coumestrol showed the highest binding affinity for VEGFA and PIK3R1 proteins together with favourable ADMET properties.

Features of the generated structure, was then deduced with respect to conformation of peptide backbone, local compatibility of the generated structure in terms of energy and molecular dynamics study. Considering these features of the generated structure, we selected all the class 1 inhibitors reported so far, which showed interactions with HDACs. Virtual screening was done using reported inhibitors (70) and using SmHDAC1 and HsHDAC1 as the targets.

37120484,"Discovery of novel direct small-molecule inhibitors targeting HIF-2alpha using structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, and MM-GBSA calculations.","Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the main regulatory factors implicated in the adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxic stress, which has provoked much interest as an attractive target for the design of promising chemotherapeutic agents. Since indirect HIF inhibitors (HIFIs) lead to the occurrence of various side effects, the need of the hour is to develop direct HIFIs, physically interacting with important functional domains within the HIF protein structure. Accordingly, in the present study, it was attempted to develop an exhaustive structure-based virtual screening (VS) process coupled with molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and MM-GBSA calculations for the identification of novel direct inhibitors against the HIF-2alpha subunit. For this purpose, a focused library of over 200,000 compounds from the NCI database was used for VS against the PAS-B domain of the target protein, HIF-2alpha. This domain was suggested to be a possible ligand-binding site, which is characterized by a large internal hydrophobic cavity, unique to the HIF-2alpha subunit. The top-ranked compounds, NSC106416, NSC217021, NSC217026, NSC215639, and NSC277811 with the best docking scores were taken up for the subsequent in silico ADME properties and PAINS filtration. The selected drug-like hits were employed for carrying out MD simulation which was followed by MM-GBSA calculations to retrieve the candidates showing the highest in silico binding affinity towards the PAS-B domain of HIF-2alpha. The analysis of results indicated that all molecules, except the NSC277811, fulfilled necessary drug-likeness properties. Four selected drug-like candidates, NSC106416, NSC217021, NSC217026, and NSC215639 were found to expose the stability profiles within the cavity located inside the PAS-B domain of HIF-2alpha over simulation time. Finally, the results of the MM-GBSA rescoring method were indicative of the highest binding affinity of NSC217026 for the binding site of the HIF-2alpha PAS-B domain among selected final hits. Consequently, the hit NSC217026 could serve as a promising scaffold for further optimization toward the design of direct HIF-2alpha inhibitors for cancer therapy.",Molecular diversity,2024
34577064,Rapid Identification of Potential Drug Candidates from Multi-Million Compounds' Repositories. Combination of 2D Similarity Search with 3D Ligand/Structure Based Methods and In Vitro Screening.,"Rapid in silico selection of target focused libraries from commercial repositories is an attractive and cost-effective approach in early drug discovery. If structures of active compounds are available, rapid 2D similarity search can be performed on multimillion compounds' databases. This approach can be combined with physico-chemical parameter and diversity filtering, bioisosteric replacements, and fragment-based approaches for performing a first round biological screening. Our objectives were to investigate the combination of 2D similarity search with various 3D ligand and structure-based methods for hit expansion and validation, in order to increase the hit rate and novelty. In the present account, six case studies are described and the efficiency of mixing is evaluated. While sequentially combined 2D/3D similarity approach increases the hit rate significantly, sequential combination of 2D similarity with pharmacophore model or 3D docking enriched the resulting focused library with novel chemotypes. Parallel integrated approaches allowed the comparison of the various 2D and 3D methods and revealed that 2D similarity-based and 3D ligand and structure-based techniques are often complementary, and their combinations represent a powerful synergy. Finally, the lessons we learnt including the advantages and pitfalls of the described approaches are discussed.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021
31711157,Computational/in silico methods in drug target and lead prediction.,"Drug-like compounds are most of the time denied approval and use owing to the unexpected clinical side effects and cross-reactivity observed during clinical trials. These unexpected outcomes resulting in significant increase in attrition rate centralizes on the selected drug targets. These targets may be disease candidate proteins or genes, biological pathways, disease-associated microRNAs, disease-related biomarkers, abnormal molecular phenotypes, crucial nodes of biological network or molecular functions. This is generally linked to several factors, including incomplete knowledge on the drug targets and unpredicted pharmacokinetic expressions upon target interaction or off-target effects. A method used to identify targets, especially for polygenic diseases, is essential and constitutes a major bottleneck in drug development with the fundamental stage being the identification and validation of drug targets of interest for further downstream processes. Thus, various computational methods have been developed to complement experimental approaches in drug discovery. Here, we present an overview of various computational methods and tools applied in predicting or validating drug targets and drug-like molecules. We provide an overview on their advantages and compare these methods to identify effective methods which likely lead to optimal results. We also explore major sources of drug failure considering the challenges and opportunities involved. This review might guide researchers on selecting the most efficient approach or technique during the computational drug discovery process.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2020
36154578,Prophylactic and Therapeutic Potential Zinc Metallodrugs Drug Discovery: Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Spike/ACE2 Inhibitors.,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV- 2) variants with novel spike protein mutations has been shown to be influencing the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Due to studies showing various dietary benefits of zinc as a viral replication inhibitor as well as an immunity enhancer, organometallic complexes incorporating zinc ions can be ideal antiviral candidates due to their structural variation and diverse stereochemistry. METHODS: In silico studies were conducted for the virtual screening of zinc complexes with SARSCoV- 2 and host proteins to explore their effect on viral entry and replication activity. Molegro Virtual Docker along with AutoDock was used for the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT), chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties (ADMET) were used to support the findings from virtual screening. RESULTS: In correlation with SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and spike receptorbinding domain bound with ACE2 docking results, the compound (bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole)- bis(2-furoato)-zinc(ii)) (CSD code ECOZAA) occurs to be a potential metal complex SARS-CoV-2 receptor inhibitor. The compound ECOZAA was observed (in silico binding affinity = - 179.29kcal/mol) to behave better than the clinically approved drug Remdesivir (in silico binding affinity = -62.69kcal/mol) against SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The large HOMO- LUMO gap for the ECOZAA compound is an indication of the low chemical reactivity as well as the great kinetic stability of the compound. CONCLUSION: Thus, this study highlights the potential use of zinc metal complexes as SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and replication inhibitors.",Current computer-aided drug design,2022
25335799,Molecular insights of protein contour recognition with ligand pharmacophoric sites through combinatorial library design and MD simulation in validating HTLV-1 PR inhibitors.,"Retroviruses HIV-1 and HTLV-1 are chiefly considered to be the most dangerous pathogens in Homo sapiens. These two viruses have structurally unique protease (PR) enzymes, which are having common function of its replication mechanism. Though HIV PR drugs failed to inhibit HTLV-1 infections, they emphatically emphasise the need for designing new lead compounds against HTLV-1 PR. Therefore, we tried to understand the binding level interactions through the charge environment present in both ligand and protein active sites. The domino effect illustrates that libraries of purvalanol-A are attuned to fill allosteric binding site of HTLV-1 PR through molecular recognition and shows proper binding of ligand pharmacophoric features in receptor contours. Our screening evaluates seven compounds from purvalanol-A libraries, and these compounds' pharmacophore searches for an appropriate place in the binding site and it places well according to respective receptor contour surfaces. Thus our result provides a platform for the progress of more effective compounds, which are better in free energy calculation, molecular docking, ADME and molecular dynamics studies. Finally, this research provided novel chemical scaffolds for HTLV-1 drug discovery.",Molecular bioSystems,2015
34737160,Discovery of novel chromone derivatives containing a sulfonamide moiety as potential anti-TSWV agents.,"A number of chromone derivatives containing sulfonamide structure were designed and synthesized. Firstly, the target compounds were evaluated for anti-TSWV activities in vivo by the half-leaf method. We found that most of the compounds had good anti-TSWV activities. Among them, compound 12B had excellent anti-TSWV inactivating activity with an EC(50) of 80.5 mug/mL, which was significantly better than xiangcaoliusuobingmi (765.7 mug/mL). Secondly, TSWV nucleocapsid protein (N) was expressed and purified, and the affinity between the compounds and TSWV N was tested by microscale thermophoresis (MST). Compound 12B had a good affinity for TSWV N with a K(d) value of 5.02 muM, which was superior to xiangcaoliusuobingmi (29.83 muM). Finally, in order to study the mode of interaction between the compound 12B and TSWV N, we carried out molecular docking. The results indicated that compound 12B might inactivate the virus by destroying the TSWV N oligomer structure. These results lay a solid foundation for the further discovery of chromone derivatives containing sulfonamide structure with high anti-TSWV activities.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2021
32101126,Decoding Protein-protein Interactions: An Overview.,"Drug discovery has focused on the paradigm ""one drug, one target"" for a long time. However, small molecules can act at multiple macromolecular targets, which serves as the basis for drug repurposing. In an effort to expand the target space, and given advances in X-ray crystallography, protein-protein interactions have become an emerging focus area of drug discovery enterprises. Proteins interact with other biomolecules and it is this intricate network of interactions that determines the behavior of the system and its biological processes. In this review, we briefly discuss networks in disease, followed by computational methods for protein-protein complex prediction. Computational methodologies and techniques employed towards objectives such as protein-protein docking, protein-protein interactions, and interface predictions are described extensively. Docking aims at producing a complex between proteins, while interface predictions identify a subset of residues on one protein that could interact with a partner, and protein-protein interaction sites address whether two proteins interact. In addition, approaches to predict hot spots and binding sites are presented along with a representative example of our internal project on the chemokine CXC receptor 3 B-isoform and predictive modeling with IP10 and PF4.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2020
26355653,Harmonization of QSAR Best Practices and Molecular Docking Provides an Efficient Virtual Screening Tool for Discovering New G-Quadruplex Ligands.,"Telomeres and telomerase are key players in tumorogenesis. Among the various strategies proposed for telomerase inhibition or telomere uncapping, the stabilization of telomeric G-quadruplex (G4) structures is a very promising one. Additionally, G4 stabilizing ligands also act over tumors mediated by the alternative elongation of telomeres. Accordingly, the discovery of novel compounds able to act on telomeres and/or inhibit the telomerase enzyme by stabilizing DNA telomeric G4 structures as well as the development of approaches efficiently prioritizing such compounds constitute active areas of research in computational medicinal chemistry and anticancer drug discovery. In this direction, we applied a virtual screening strategy based on the rigorous application of QSAR best practices and its harmonized integration with structure-based methods. More than 600,000 compounds from commercial databases were screened, the first 99 compounds were prioritized, and 21 commercially available and structurally diverse candidates were purchased and submitted to experimental assays. Such strategy proved to be highly efficient in the prioritization of G4 stabilizer hits, with a hit rate of 23.5%. The best G4 stabilizer hit found exhibited a shift in melting temperature from FRET assay of +7.3  degrees C at 5 muM, while three other candidates also exhibited a promising stabilizing profile. The two most promising candidates also exhibited a good telomerase inhibitory ability and a mild inhibition of HeLa cells growth. None of these candidates showed antiproliferative effects in normal fibroblasts. Finally, the proposed virtual screening strategy proved to be a practical and reliable tool for the discovery of novel G4 ligands which can be used as starting points of further optimization campaigns.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2015
31134745,Virtual Screening Based on Ensemble Docking Targeting Wild-Type p53 for Anticancer Drug Discovery.,"The tumor-suppressor function of p53 makes it an attractive drug target. Efforts were mostly put on stabilization of the functional p53 or reactivation of mutated p53. Previous studies have shown that small molecules targeting Loop1/Sheet3 (L1/S3) can reactivate the R175H-p53 and stabilize p53 in vitro. Since the L1/S3 pocket is shared by the mutate and the wild type (WT) p53, virtual screening is introduced to identify natural products targeting the L1/S3 of WT p53. Considering the high flexibility of Loop1, ensemble docking method is utilized for different clusters of the L1/S3. Seven conformations were chosen for docking. As one of the 181 selected candidates, torilin not only improved p53 activity, but also increased p21 protein expression level, which lies downstream of p53, therefore suppressing HCT116 cancer cell growth. Torilin may covalently bind to Cys124 of p53 by 2-methyl-2-butenal (2M2B) group, as torilin derivatives, which do not contain the 2M2B group, were not able to increase the p53 transcription activity. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that L1/S3 of WT-p53 is a druggable pocket, and torilin has a potential cytotoxicity through activating the p53 pathway.",Chemistry & biodiversity,2019
32533370,Side chain virtual screening of matched molecular pairs: a PDB-wide and ChEMBL-wide analysis.,"Optimization in medicinal chemistry often involves designing replacements for a section of a molecule which aim to retain potency while improving other properties of the compound. In this study, we perform a retrospective analysis using a number of computational methods to identify active side chains amongst a pool of random decoy side chains, mimicking a similar procedure that might be undertaken in a real medicinal chemistry project. We constructed a dataset derived from public ChEMBL and PDB data by identifying all ChEMBL assays where at least one of the compounds tested has also been co-crystallized in the PDB. Additionally, we required that there be at least ten active compounds tested in the same ChEMBL assay that are matched molecular pairs to the crystallized ligand. Using the compiled dataset consisting of sets of compounds from 402 assays, we have tested a number of methods for scoring side chains including Spark, a bioisostere replacement tool from Cresset, molecular docking using Glide from Schrodinger, docking with Smina, as well as other methods. In this work, we present a comparison of the performance of these methods in discriminating active side chains from decoys as well as recommendations for circumstances when different methods should be used.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2020

Despite the current several direct antiviral agents in the treatment of Hepatitis C, the standard treatment for HCV infection is accompanied by several drawbacks, such as adverse side effects, high pricing of medications and the rapid emerging rate of resistant HCV variants. OBJECTIVES: To discover potential inhibitors for HCV helicase through an optimized in silico approach. METHODS: In this study, a homology model (HCV Genotype 3 helicase) was used as the target and screened through a benzopyran-based virtual library.

Different molecular modeling approaches such as pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations have been used to develop new CK2 inhibitors. This study presents a pharmacophore model that was generated by combining and merging the structure-based and ligand-based pharmacophore features and validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Based on validation results revealing good predictive ability, this pharmacophore model was used as a three-dimensional query in a virtual screening simulation. Several compounds with different chemical scaffolds were retrieved as hits, which were further analyzed and refined using several molecular property filters. The obtained compounds were then filtered and compared to the crystallographic ligand on the basis of their predicted docking energies, binding mode, and interactions with CK2 active site residues. This step resulted in a compound with a high pharmacophore fit value and better docking energy. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated stable binding of the predicted compound to CK2 protein, characterized by root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and hydrogen bond.

Here, we report a structure-based approach to identify chemically diverse and potent inhibitors of LAT1. First, a homology model of LAT1 that is based on the atomic structures of the prokaryotic homologs was constructed. Molecular docking of nitrogen mustards (NMs) with a wide range of affinity allowed for deriving a common binding mode that could explain the structure-activity relationship pattern in NMs. Subsequently, validated binding hypotheses were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation, which allowed for extracting a set of dynamic pharmacophores.

28462843,Covalent inhibitors of LgtC: A blueprint for the discovery of non-substrate-like inhibitors for bacterial glycosyltransferases.,"Non-substrate-like inhibitors of glycosyltransferases are sought after as chemical tools and potential lead compounds for medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel small molecular inhibitor chemotype for LgtC, a retaining alpha-1,4-galactosyltransferase involved in bacterial lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis. The new inhibitors, which are structurally unrelated to both the donor and acceptor of LgtC, have low micromolar inhibitory activity, comparable to the best substrate-based inhibitors. We provide experimental evidence that these inhibitors react covalently with LgtC. Results from detailed enzymological experiments with wild-type and mutant LgtC suggest the non-catalytic active site residue Cys246 as a likely target residue for these inhibitors. Analysis of available sequence and structural data reveals that non-catalytic cysteines are a common motif in the active site of many bacterial glycosyltransferases. Our results can therefore serve as a blueprint for the rational design of non-substrate-like, covalent inhibitors against a broad range of other bacterial glycosyltransferases.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2017
29127582,Lessons learned from participating in D3R 2016 Grand Challenge 2: compounds targeting the farnesoid X receptor.,"D3R 2016 Grand Challenge 2 focused on predictions of binding modes and affinities for 102 compounds against the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In this challenge, two distinct methods, a docking-based method and a template-based method, were employed by our team for the binding mode prediction. For the new template-based method, 3D ligand similarities were calculated for each query compound against the ligands in the co-crystal structures of FXR available in Protein Data Bank. The binding mode was predicted based on the co-crystal protein structure containing the ligand with the best ligand similarity score against the query compound. For the FXR dataset, the template-based method achieved a better performance than the docking-based method on the binding mode prediction. For the binding affinity prediction, an in-house knowledge-based scoring function ITScore2 and MM/PBSA approach were employed. Good performance was achieved for MM/PBSA, whereas the performance of ITScore2 was sensitive to ligand composition, e.g. the percentage of carbon atoms in the compounds. The sensitivity to ligand composition could be a clue for the further improvement of our knowledge-based scoring function.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2018

32824756,How Do Molecular Dynamics Data Complement Static Structural Data of GPCRs.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are implicated in nearly every physiological process in the human body and therefore represent an important drug targeting class. Advances in X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided multiple static structures of GPCRs in complex with various signaling partners. However, GPCR functionality is largely determined by their flexibility and ability to transition between distinct structural conformations. Due to this dynamic nature, a static snapshot does not fully explain the complexity of GPCR signal transduction. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer the opportunity to simulate the structural motions of biological processes at atomic resolution. Thus, this technique can incorporate the missing information on protein flexibility into experimentally solved structures. Here, we review the contribution of MD simulations to complement static structural data and to improve our understanding of GPCR physiology and pharmacology, as well as the challenges that still need to be overcome to reach the full potential of this technique.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020

In contrast to previous models that focused primarily on SMILES strings or molecular graphs, our model placed a special emphasis on the substructure information on molecules, enabling the model to learn richer chemical rules and structure features from fragments and chemical reaction information on molecules. To accomplish this, we fragmented the molecules to construct heterogeneous graph representations based on atom and fragment information. Then our model mapped the heterogeneous graph data into a latent vector space by using an encoder and employed a self-regressive generative model as a decoder for molecular generation. Additionally, we performed transfer learning on the model using a small set of ligand molecules known to be active against the target protein to generate molecules that bind better to the target protein. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is highly competitive with state-of-the-art models. It can generate valid and diverse molecules with favorable physicochemical properties and drug-likeness. Importantly, they produce novel molecules with high docking scores against the target proteins.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024

33991627,Discovery of a new class of JMJD6 inhibitors and structure-activity relationship study.,"JmjC domain-containing protein 6 (JMJD6) has been thought as a potential target for various diseases particularly cancer. However, few selective JMJD6 inhibitors have been reported. In this investigation, molecular docking and biological activity evaluation were performed to retrieve new JMJD6 inhibitors, which led to the identification of a hit compound, J2. Further structural optimization and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis towards J2 were carried out, which gave a new potent JMJD6 inhibitor, 7p. This compound showed an IC(50) value of 0.681 muM against JMJD6, but displayed no activity against other tested JmjC domain-containing protein family members, indicating good selectivity (>100 fold). Collectively, this investigation offers a selective JMJD6 inhibitor, which could be taken as a lead compound for subsequent drug discovery targeting JMJD6.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2021
25625646,Molecular docking screening using agonist-bound GPCR structures: probing the A2A adenosine receptor.,"Crystal structures of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have recently revealed the molecular basis of ligand binding and activation, which has provided exciting opportunities for structure-based drug design. The A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) is a promising therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases, but progress in this area is limited by the lack of novel agonist scaffolds. We carried out docking screens of 6.7 million commercially available molecules against active-like conformations of the A2AAR to investigate whether these structures could guide the discovery of agonists. Nine out of the 20 predicted agonists were confirmed to be A2AAR ligands, but none of these activated the ARs. The difficulties in discovering AR agonists using structure-based methods originated from limited atomic-level understanding of the activation mechanism and a chemical bias toward antagonists in the screened library. In particular, the composition of the screened library was found to strongly reduce the likelihood of identifying AR agonists, which reflected the high ligand complexity required for receptor activation. Extension of this analysis to other pharmaceutically relevant GPCRs suggested that library screening may not be suitable for targets requiring a complex receptor-ligand interaction network. Our results provide specific directions for the future development of novel A2AAR agonists and general strategies for structure-based drug discovery.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2015
32401384,Using machine learning to improve ensemble docking for drug discovery.,"Ensemble docking has provided an inexpensive method to account for receptor flexibility in molecular docking for virtual screening. Unfortunately, as there is no rigorous theory to connect the docking scores from multiple structures to measured activity, researchers have not yet come up with effective ways to use these scores to classify compounds into actives and inactives. This shortcoming has led to the decrease, rather than an increase in the performance of classifying compounds when more structures are added to the ensemble. Previously, we suggested machine learning, implemented in the form of a naive Bayesian model could alleviate this problem. However, the naive Bayesian model assumed that the probabilities of observing the docking scores to different structures to be independent. This approximation might prevent it from achieving even higher performance. In the work presented in this paper, we have relaxed this approximation when using several other machine learning methods-k nearest neighbor, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest-to improve ensemble docking. We found significant improvement.",Proteins,2020
32092396,Natural-product-library-based screening for discovery of capsid C-terminal domain targeted HIV-1 inhibitors.,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and limit disease progression. However, ART is unable to eradicate the virus, and the requirement for lifelong treatment may have side effects and may lead to the development of resistance. New approaches to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection should therefore be developed. HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein is an unexploited but attractive target for antiviral drug development. The hydrophobic cavity of the C-terminal domain of CA (CA CTD) has been validated as a potential target for antiviral drugs. Binding of compounds to this conserved non-polar groove in CA CTD allosterically disrupts the CA assembly. This study screened 2080 natural products to identify potential antiviral agents for further development to combat HIV-1 infection. From the primary screen at a fixed concentration of 50 microM, 16 compounds were found to be effective against this target. Six compounds observed in the primary screen were confirmed in dose-response experiments, and were tested against HIV-1-induced cytopathic effects. Two compounds were found to inhibit HIV-1 replication, and the most active compound - rubranol - inhibited viral replication at a moderate micromolar concentration (EC(50) = 15.85 muM). The binding modes of rubranol and hirsutanonol to CA CTD were analysed by molecular docking, providing insight for the design of drugs targeting HIV-1 CA. This study reports, for the first time, identification of natural products that showed potential as anti-HIV-1 agents by targeting the conserved hydrophobic cavity of HIV-1 CA CTD.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2020

30884446,Structure-based virtual screening for novel chymase inhibitors by in silico fragment mapping.,"The term chymase refers to a family of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases stored within the secretory granules of mast cells. Recently, a variety of small molecule inhibitors for chymase have been developed with a primary focus on the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the expected therapeutic benefit of these chymase inhibitors, they have not been used clinically. Here, we attempted to identify new chymase inhibitors using a multistep structure-based virtual screening protocol combined with our knowledge-based in silico fragment mapping technique. The mapping procedure identified fragments with novel modes of interaction at the oxyanion hole of chymase. Next, we constructed a three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore model and retrieved eight candidate chymase inhibitors from a commercial database that included approximately five million compounds. This selection was achieved using a multistep virtual screening protocol, which combined a 3D pharmacophore-based search, docking calculations, and analyses of binding free energy.

25916860,Machine-learning scoring functions for identifying native poses of ligands docked to known and novel proteins.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular docking is a widely-employed method in structure-based drug design. An essential component of molecular docking programs is a scoring function (SF) that can be used to identify the most stable binding pose of a ligand, when bound to a receptor protein, from among a large set of candidate poses. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited docking power (or ability to successfully identify the correct pose) has been a major impediment to cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes to predict the native or near-native pose of a ligand docked to a receptor protein's binding site. We assess the docking accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark dataset on both diverse and homogeneous (protein-family-specific) test sets. Further, we perform a systematic analysis of the performance of the proposed SFs in identifying native poses of ligands that are docked to novel protein targets. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We find that the best performing ML SF has a success rate of 80% in identifying poses that are within 1 A root-mean-square deviation from the native poses of 65 different protein families. This is in comparison to a success rate of only 70% achieved by the best conventional SF, ASP, employed in the commercial docking software GOLD. In addition, the proposed ML SFs perform better on novel proteins that they were never trained on before. We also observed steady gains in the performance of these scoring functions as the training set size and number of features were increased by considering more protein-ligand complexes and/or more computationally-generated poses for each complex.",BMC bioinformatics,2015
30095890,The Recognition of Unrelated Ligands by Identical Proteins.,"Unrelated ligands, often found in drug discovery campaigns, can bind to the same receptor, even with the same protein residues. To investigate how this might occur, and whether it might be typically possible to find unrelated ligands for the same drug target, we sought examples of topologically unrelated ligands that bound to the same protein in the same site. Seventy-six pairs of ligands, each bound to the same protein (152 complexes total), were considered, classified into three groups. In the first (31 pairs of complexes), unrelated ligands interacted largely with the same pocket residues through different functional groups. In the second group (39 pairs), the unrelated ligand in each pair engaged different residues, though still within the same pocket. The smallest group (6 pairs) contained ligands with different scaffolds but with shared functional groups interacting with the same residues. We found that there are multiple chemically unrelated but physically similar functional groups that can complement any given local protein pocket; when these functional group substitutions are combined within a single molecule, they lead to topologically unrelated ligands that can each well-complement a site. It may be that many active and orthosteric sites can recognize topologically unrelated ligands.",ACS chemical biology,2018

HDAC8, a unique class I zinc-dependent HDAC, is becoming a potential target in cancer and other diseases. In the current study, a novel series of N-hydroxy-3-sulfamoylbenzamide-based HDAC8 selective inhibitors (12a-12p) were designed and synthesized, among which compounds 12a, 12b and 12c exhibited potent HDAC8 inhibition with two-digit nanomolar IC(50) values, and considerable selectivity over HDAC2 (>180-fold) and HDAC6 ( approximately 30-fold) which was confirmed by western blot analysis. It is worth noting that 12a, 12b and 12c displayed highly selective anti-proliferative activity to T-cell leukemia cell lines Jurkat, Molt-4 and neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE-(2). Such selective cytotoxicity was also observed in the well-known HDAC8 selective inhibitor PCI-34051 but not in the pan-HDAC inhibitors SAHA and PXD101, indicating that HDAC8 selective inhibitor should have preferable benefit-risk profile in comparison with pan-HDAC inhibitor.

There exists an urgent unmet clinical need for anti-ZIKV drugs for the treatment of infected individuals. In the current work, we aimed at the promising virus drug target, ZIKV NS3 protease and constructed a Pharmacophore Anchor (PA) model for the active site. The PA model reveals a total of 12 anchors (E, H, V) mapped across the active site subpockets. We further identified five of these anchors to be critical core anchors (CEH1, CH3, CH7, CV1, CV3) conserved across flaviviral proteases. The ZIKV protease PA model was then applied in anchor-enhanced virtual screening yielding 14 potential antiviral candidates, which were tested by in vitro assays. We discovered FDA drugs Asunaprevir and Simeprevir to have potent anti-ZIKV activities with EC(50) values 4.7 microM and 0.4 microM, inhibiting the viral protease with IC(50) values 6.0 microM and 2.6 microM respectively. Additionally, the PA model anchors aided in the exploration of inhibitor binding mechanisms. In conclusion, our PA model serves as a promising guide map for ZIKV protease targeted drug discovery and the identified 'previr' FDA drugs are promising for anti-ZIKV treatments.",Scientific reports,2020

30039423,Application of Multiscale Simulation Tools on GPCRs. An Example with Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the biggest class of membrane proteins included in signal transduction cascade across the biological lipid bilayers. They are essential target structures for cell signaling and are of great commercial interest to the pharmaceutical industry (~50% of marketed drugs and ~25% of top-selling drugs targeting this receptor family). Recent advances made in molecular biology and computational chemistry open new avenues for the design of new therapeutic compounds. Molecular biology has recently provided the crystal structures of a few ligand-bound GPCRs in active and inactive states, which can be used as accurate templates in modeling studies. Computational chemistry offers a range of simulation, multiscale modeling with ligand- and structure-based approaches, and virtual screening tools for definition and analysis of protein-ligand, protein-protein, and protein-DNA interactions. Development of new approaches and algorithms on statistical methods and free energy simulations help to predict novel optimal compounds. Integrated approach to drug discovery that combines quantum mechanics calculations, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR), and de novo design studies under a single umbrella can be used for decreasing the risk of false-positive results. Each method has its own pros and cons and, when used alone, is not likely to yield very useful results. However, when these methods are combined with positive feedback loops, they may enhance each other and successful drug leads may be obtained. Moreover, investigating the activation mechanisms and atomistic determinants of ligand binding to GPCR targets would allow greater safety in the human life.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2018

35220906,Molecular modelling studies and identification of novel phytochemical inhibitor of DLL3.,"Prostate cancer has been recently considered the most diagnosed cancer in male. DLL3 is overexpressed in CRPC-NE but not in localised prostate cancer or BPH. There are no effective treatments for neuroendocrine differentiated prostate cancer due to a lack of understanding of DLL3 structure and function. The structure of DLL3 is not yet determined using any experimental techniques. Hence, the structure-based drug discovery approach against prostate cancer has not shown great success. In present study, molecular modelling techniques were employed to generate three-dimensional structure of DLL3 and performed its thorough structural analysis. Further, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain energetically favourable conformation. Further, we used a virtual screening using a library of >13800 phytochemicals from the IMPPAT database and other literature to select the best possible phytochemical inhibitor for DLL3 and identified the top five compounds. Relative binding affinity was calculated using the MM-PBSA approach. ADMET properties of the screened compounds reveal the toxic effect of Gnemonol C. We believe these studied physicochemical properties, functional domain identification, and binding site identification would be very useful to gain more structural and functional insights of DLL3; also, it can be used to infer their pharmacodynamics properties of DLL3 which was recently reported as an important prostate cancer target. The current study also proposes that Ergosterol Peroxide, Dioslupecin A, Mulberrofuran K, and Caracurine V have strong affinities and could serve as plausible inhibitors against DLL3. We believe this study would further help develop better drug candidates against neuroendocrine prostate cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2023

38287509,AI-driven covalent drug design strategies targeting main protease (m(pro)) against SARS-CoV-2: structural insights and molecular mechanisms.,"The emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. To address this challenge, small-molecule antivirals have been proposed as a crucial therapeutic option. Among potential targets for anti-COVID-19 therapy, the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is important due to its essential role in the virus's life cycle and high conservation. The substrate-binding region of the core proteases of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), could be used for the generation of new protease inhibitors. Various drug discovery methods have employed a diverse range of strategies, targeting both monomeric and dimeric forms, including drug repurposing, integrating virtual screening with high-throughput screening (HTS), and structure-based drug design, each demonstrating varying levels of efficiency. Covalent inhibitors, such as Nirmatrelvir and MG-101, showcase robust and high-affinity binding to Mpro, exhibiting stable interactions confirmed by molecular docking studies.

31397386,Isovaleric acid and avicequinone-C are Chikungunya virus resistance principles in Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) Correa.,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Oral administration of tender leaf extract of Glycosmis pentaphylla is traditionally known to prevent the chikungunya virus infection. Even with wide usage, the antiviral components in this plant are neither identified nor characterized. This study was carried out with the objectives of profiling the phytocompounds in this plant through LC-MS/MS and to identify the active antiviral constituents and their drug-likeliness through molecular docking. METHODS: Phytocompounds were extracted hydro-alcoholically from powdered plant parts and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Based on mass-to-charge ratio from LC-MS/MS, compounds were identified and used as ligands for molecular docking against chikungunya target proteins. The active principles were subjected to ADME/T analysis to verify their drug-likeliness. RESULTS: The docking results and ADME/T evaluation showed that the compounds, isovaleric acid and avicequinone- C have good interaction with the protein targets and hence could be the antiviral principles of the selected plant. These compounds presented acceptable drug properties and hence could be carried forward to in vivo studies for drug development. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The antiviral properties of G. pentaphylla are known since time-immemorial. This study revealed the probable interactions after the oral administration of tender leaves of Glycosmis in preventing the chikungunya virus infection and paves the path for designing future plant-based drugs.",Journal of vector borne diseases,2019
36941232,Vina-GPU 2.0: Further Accelerating AutoDock Vina and Its Derivatives with Graphics Processing Units.,"Modern drug discovery typically faces large virtual screens from huge compound databases where multiple docking tools are involved for meeting various real scenes or improving the precision of virtual screens. Among these tools, AutoDock Vina and its numerous derivatives are the most popular and have become the standard pipeline for molecular docking in modern drug discovery. Our recent Vina-GPU method realized 14-fold acceleration against AutoDock Vina on a piece of NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU in one virtual screening case. Further speedup of AutoDock Vina and its derivatives with graphics processing units (GPUs) is beneficial to systematically push their popularization in large-scale virtual screens due to their high benefit-cost ratio and easy operation for users. Thus, we proposed the Vina-GPU 2.0 method to further accelerate AutoDock Vina and the most common derivatives with new docking algorithms (QuickVina 2 and QuickVina-W) with GPUs. Caused by the discrepancy in their docking algorithms, our Vina-GPU 2.0 adopts different GPU acceleration strategies. In virtual screening for two hot protein kinase targets, RIPK1 and RIPK3, from the DrugBank database, our Vina-GPU 2.0 reaches an average of 65.6-fold, 1.4-fold, and 3.6-fold docking acceleration against the original AutoDock Vina, QuickVina 2, and QuickVina-W while ensuring their comparable docking accuracy. In addition, we develop a friendly and installation-free graphical user interface tool for their convenient usage. The codes and tools of Vina-GPU 2.0 are freely available at https://github.com/DeltaGroupNJUPT/Vina-GPU-2.0, coupled with explicit instructions and examples.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2023
34272496,Structure-based molecular networking for the target discovery of novel germicidin derivatives from the sponge-associated streptomyces sp. 18A01.,"Four new alpha-pyrone derivatives, named germicidins P-S (1-4) along with nine known analogues (5-13) were discovered from the sponge-associated Streptomyces sp. 18A01 guided by Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking, the LC-DAD-MS profile, and hexokinase II (HK2) inhibitory activity. The structures of 1-13 were elucidated by analysis of their HRMS, optical rotation, and NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute configurations of germicidin P (1) and germicidin Q (2) were determined on the basis of comparisons of experimental and theoretically calculated ECD spectra. Bioactivities of the isolated compounds were assayed against human HK2. The bioassay results showed that compounds 1-4 and 11-13 exhibited significant inhibitory activities against HK2, with IC(50) values ranging from 5.1 to 11.0 muM. A molecular docking simulation demonstrated that these germicidins were docked in the inner active site tunnel of HK2. Interestingly, the amino residue Arg91 has a better binding affinity and efficacy than the amino residue Asn89 in the process of HK2 binding to the ligands, resulting in better hexokinase inhibitory activity. This result provided a valuable perspective for better understanding their HK2 inhibition activity.",The Journal of antibiotics,2021
34000483,Structure-based discovery of potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).,"STAT3 has been validated as an attractive anticancer target due to its important roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, discovery of potent and selective STAT3 small-molecule inhibitors with druglike properties is still challenging. In this study, two series of substituted 2-phenylquinolines and 2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were designed through structure-based drug discovery approach by condensing the privileged structures of STX-119 and SH4-54. Our study has resulted in the discovery of a number of highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitors, exemplified by compound 39 with the privileged structure of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, which selectively inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 and suppresses subsequent signaling pathway. Moreover, 39 inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion of human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lines. Consistently, it achieves significant and dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in both cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft tumor models in mice. These results clearly indicate that 39 is a highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2021
38177766,Computing the relative binding affinity of ligands based on a pairwise binding comparison network.,"Structure-based lead optimization is an open challenge in drug discovery, which is still largely driven by hypotheses and depends on the experience of medicinal chemists. Here we propose a pairwise binding comparison network (PBCNet) based on a physics-informed graph attention mechanism, specifically tailored for ranking the relative binding affinity among congeneric ligands. Benchmarking on two held-out sets (provided by Schrodinger and Merck) containing over 460 ligands and 16 targets, PBCNet demonstrated substantial advantages in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Equipped with a fine-tuning operation, the performance of PBCNet reaches that of Schrodinger's FEP+, which is much more computationally intensive and requires substantial expert intervention. A further simulation-based experiment showed that active learning-optimized PBCNet may accelerate lead optimization campaigns by 473%. Finally, for the convenience of users, a web service for PBCNet is established to facilitate complex relative binding affinity prediction through an easy-to-operate graphical interface.",Nature computational science,2023
28199769,Protein-Templated Formation of an Inhibitor of the Blood Coagulation Factor Xa through a Background-Free Amidation Reaction.,"Protein-templated reactions enable the target-guided formation of protein ligands from reactive fragments, ideally with no background reaction. Herein, we investigate the templated formation of amides. A nucleophilic fragment that binds to the coagulation factor Xa was incubated with the protein and thirteen differentially activated dipeptides. The protein induced a non-catalytic templated reaction for the phenyl and trifluoroethyl esters; the latter was shown to be a completely background-free reaction. Starting from two fragments with millimolar affinity, a 29 nm superadditive inhibitor of factor Xa was obtained. The fragment ligation reaction was detected with high sensitivity by an enzyme activity assay and by mass spectrometry. The reaction progress and autoinhibition of the templated reaction by the formed ligation product were determined, and the structure of the protein-inhibitor complex was elucidated.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2017
26397018,Open access chemical probes for epigenetic targets.,"BACKGROUND: High attrition rates in drug discovery call for new approaches to improve target validation. Academia is filling gaps, but often lacks the experience and resources of the pharmaceutical industry resulting in poorly characterized tool compounds. DISCUSSION: The SGC has established an open access chemical probe consortium, currently encompassing ten pharmaceutical companies. One of its mandates is to create well-characterized inhibitors (chemical probes) for epigenetic targets to enable new biology and target validation for drug development.

These probes have proven to be critical complementation to traditional genetic targeting strategies and provided sometimes surprising results.",Future medicinal chemistry,2015
30396051,"Rapid identification of urokinase plasminogen activator inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicines based on ultrafiltration, LC-MS and in silico docking.","The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is regarded as the crucial trigger for plasmin generation, which is involved in several diseases especially for neoplasm metastasis. In this study, an efficient approach integrating ultrafiltration, LC/MS, bioassay and in silico docking, was proposed for rapidly detecting uPA ligands from Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs). Forty-two TCMs were initially assessed, and as illustrative case studies, Galla Chinensis and Sanguisorbae Radix, which appeared significant inhibitory activities on uPA, were chosen to develpe and verify the strategy. A total of seven uPA ligands were successfully detected and identified. Two of them, pentagalloylglucose and 28-O-beta-d-glucopyranosyl pomolic acid, were demonstrated to be potential inhibitors, with IC(50) at 1.639 muM and 37.82 muM repectively. Furthermore, a combinatorial compound library screening combined with in silico docking assay, was revealed that ursolic acid (IC(50) = 2.623 muM) was also speculated to be a potent parent structure for inhibition of uPA. This approach offers a multidimensional perspective to discover uPA-binding leading compounds from TCMs or other complex mixtures, which would provide an efficient route for drug discovery.",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019
36883864,Potential drug candidates as P-glycoprotein inhibitors to reverse multidrug resistance in cancer: an in silico drug discovery study.,"The failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of carcinoma is mainly due to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR), which is largely caused by the overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1/MDR1). Until recently, the 3D structure of the P-gp transporter has not been experimentally resolved, which restricted the discovery of prospective P-gp inhibitors utilizing in silico techniques. In this study, the binding energies of 512 drug candidates in clinical or investigational stages were assessed as potential P-gp inhibitors employing in silico methods. On the basis of the available experimental data, the performance of the AutoDock4.2.6 software to predict the drug-P-gp binding mode was initially validated. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy computations were subsequently conducted to screen the investigated drug candidates. Based on the current results, five promising drug candidates, namely valspodar, dactinomycin, elbasvir, temsirolimus, and sirolimus, showed promising binding energies against P-gp transporter with DeltaG(binding) values of -126.7, -112.1, -111.9, -102.9, and -101.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The post-MD analyses revealed the energetical and structural stabilities of the identified drug candidates in complex with the P-gp transporter. Furthermore, in order to mimic the physiological conditions, the potent drugs complexed with the P-gp were subjected to 100 ns MD simulations in an explicit membrane-water environment. The pharmacokinetic properties of the identified drugs were predicted and demonstrated good ADMET characteristics. Overall, these results indicated that valspodar, dactinomycin, elbasvir, temsirolimus, and sirolimus hold promise as prospective P-gp inhibitors and warrant further invitro/invivo investigations.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2023
38174578,Structure-based drug discovery to identify SARS-CoV2 spike protein-ACE2 interaction inhibitors.,"After the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undergone a dynamic evolution driven by the acquisition of genetic modifications, resulting in several variants that are further classified as variants of interest (VOIs), variants under monitoring (VUM) and variants of concern (VOC) by World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, there are five SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma and Omicron), two VOIs (Lambda and Mu) and several other VOIs that have been reported globally. In this study, we report a natural compound, Curcumin, as the potential inhibitor to the interactions between receptor binding domain (RBD(S1)) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) domains and showcased its inhibitory potential for the Delta and Omicron variants through a computational approach by implementing state of the art methods. The study for the first time revealed a higher efficiency of Curcumin, especially for hindering the interaction between RBD(S1) and hACE-2 domains of Delta and Omicron variants as compared to other lead compounds. We investigated that the mutations in the RBD(S1) of VOC especially Delta and Omicron variants affect its structure compared to that of the wild type and other variants and therefore altered its binding to the hACE2 receptor. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses substantially supported the findings in terms of the stability of the docked complexes. This study offers compelling evidence, warranting a more in-depth exploration into the impact of these alterations on the binding of identified drug molecules with the Spike protein. Further investigation into their potential therapeutic effects in vivo is highly recommended.",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2025
35758564,"Target-based virtual screening, computational multiscoring docking and molecular dynamics simulation of small molecules as promising drug candidate affecting kinesin-like protein KIFC1.","The kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) is an essential protein that facilitates the bipolar division of neoplastic cells. Inhibiting KIFC1 by small molecules is a lucrative strategy to impede bipolar mitosis leading to the apoptosis of cancerous cells. The research aims to envisage small-molecule inhibitors targeting KIFC1. The Mcule database, a comprehensive online digital platform containing more than five million chemical compounds, was used for structure-based virtual screening (SBVS). Druglikeness filtration sifted 2,293,282 chemical hits that further narrowed down to 49 molecules after toxicity profiling. Finally, 39 compounds that comply with the BOILED-Egg permeation predictive model of the ADME rules were carried forward for multiscoring docking using the AutoDock Vina inbuilt to Mcule drug discovery platform, DockThor and SwissDock tools. The mean of DeltaG terms produced by docking tools was computed to find consensus top ligand hits. AZ82 exhibited stronger binding (Consensus DeltaG: -7.99 kcal mol(-1) ) with KIFC1 among reference inhibitors, for example, CW069 (-7.57 kcal mol(-1) ) and SR31527 (-7.01 kcal mol(-1) ).

The top four ligands and AZ82 were considered for molecular dynamics simulation of 50 ns duration. Toxicity profiling, physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, solubility, pharmacokinetics, druglikeness, medicinal chemistry attributes, average potential energy, RMSD, RMSF, SASA, DeltaGsolv and Rg analyses forecast the ligand mcule-4895338547 as a promising inhibitor of KIFC1.",Cell biochemistry and function,2022
33669738,Computational Selectivity Assessment of Protease Inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.,"The pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious global health threat. Since no specific therapeutics are available, researchers around the world screened compounds to inhibit various molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 including its main protease (M(pro)) essential for viral replication. Due to the high urgency of these discovery efforts, off-target binding, which is one of the major reasons for drug-induced toxicity and safety-related drug attrition, was neglected. Here, we used molecular docking, toxicity profiling, and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) protocols to assess the selectivity of 33 reported non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) against eight proteases and 16 anti-targets. The panel of proteases included SARS-CoV M(pro), cathepsin G, caspase-3, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), thrombin, factor Xa, chymase, and prostasin. Several of the assessed compounds presented considerable off-target binding towards the panel of proteases, as well as the selected anti-targets. Our results further suggest a high risk of off-target binding to chymase and cathepsin G. Thus, in future discovery projects, experimental selectivity assessment should be directed toward these proteases. A systematic selectivity assessment of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors, as we report it, was not previously conducted.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021
31721338,Cross-docking benchmark for automated pose and ranking prediction of ligand binding.,"Significant efforts have been devoted in the last decade to improving molecular docking techniques to predict both accurate binding poses and ranking affinities. Some shortcomings in the field are the limited number of standard methods for measuring docking success and the availability of widely accepted standard data sets for use as benchmarks in comparing different docking algorithms throughout the field. In order to address these issues, we have created a Cross-Docking Benchmark server. The server is a versatile cross-docking data set containing 4,399 protein-ligand complexes across 95 protein targets intended to serve as benchmark set and gold standard for state-of-the-art pose and ranking prediction in easy, medium, hard, or very hard docking targets.

CDK8 expression associates with the activation of beta-catenin in colon and gastric cancers. Herein, we applied docking-based virtual screening (VS) using the multiple crystal structures to identify several potent CDK8 inhibitors. The appropriate use of multiple crystal structures obtained a better enrichment of CDK8 conformations to cope with the protein flexibility. Later on, the 2D similarity search was used to find the derivatives of the high inhibitory CDK8 inhibitors we discovered by VS. Finally, we measured the dose response behaviors, the IC50 values of compound W-34, W-37, W-8, WS-2 are 6.5 nM, 36 nM, 93 nM, 9 nM, respectively.

Because of the harmful secondary effects of synthesized therapeutic molecules, the development of research has been oriented towards phytomedicines. Phenolic compounds from medicinal plants are constantly explored for new therapeutic use. METHODS: In this paper, we studied interactions between main enzymes responsible for causing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and phenolic compounds from nettle (Urtica dioica L.) using molecular Docking with Molecular Operating Environment Software (MOE). RESULTS: Docking results show a common molecule (secoisolariciresinol), which may form stable complexes with depeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), alpha-amylase and beta-glucosidase with binding energy of -7.04732084 kcal/mol, -3.82946181 kcal/mol and -4.16077089 kcal/mol respectively. Besides secoisolariciresinol, other phenolic compounds give better docking score than the original co-crystallized ligand for alpha-amylase (PDB ID 5U3A) and beta-glucosidase (PDB ID 1OGS). CONCLUSION: The obtained results are promising for the discovery of new alpha-amylase and betaglucosidase inhibitors.

29258359,Discovery of antimicrobial compounds targeting bacterial type FAD synthetases.,"The increase of bacterial strains resistant to most of the available antibiotics shows a need to explore novel antibacterial targets to discover antimicrobial drugs. Bifunctional bacterial FAD synthetases (FADSs) synthesise the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These cofactors act in vital processes as part of flavoproteins, making FADS an essential enzyme. Bacterial FADSs are potential antibacterial targets because of differences to mammalian enzymes, particularly at the FAD producing site. We have optimised an activity-based high throughput screening assay targeting Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FADS (CaFADS) that identifies inhibitors of its different activities. We selected the three best high-performing inhibitors of the FMN:adenylyltransferase activity (FMNAT) and studied their inhibition mechanisms and binding properties. The specificity of the CaFADS hits was evaluated by studying also their effect on the Streptococcus pneumoniae FADS activities, envisaging differences that can be used to discover species-specific antibacterial drugs.

34148292,Fragment-based in silico design of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.,"3CLpro is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection; its inhibition using small molecules is a potential therapeutic strategy. In this study, a comprehensive crystallography-guided fragment-based drug discovery approach was employed to design new inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. All small molecules co-crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank were used as inputs. Fragments sitting in the binding pocket (87) were grouped into eight geographical types. They were interactively coupled using various synthetically reasonable linkers to generate larger molecules with divalent binding modes taking advantage of two different fragments' interactions. In total, 1,251 compounds were proposed, and 7,158 stereoisomers were screened using Glide (standard precision and extra precision), AutoDock Vina, and Prime MMGBSA. The top 22 hits having conformations approaching the linear combination of their constituent fragments were selected for MD simulation on Desmond. MD simulation suggested 15 of these did adopt conformations very close to their constituent pieces with far higher binding affinity than either constituent domain alone.

27411028,"Discovery of Covalent Ligands via Noncovalent Docking by Dissecting Covalent Docking Based on a ""Steric-Clashes Alleviating Receptor (SCAR)"" Strategy.","Covalent ligands modulating protein activities/signals have attracted unprecedented attention in recent years, but the insufficient understanding of their advantages in the early days of drug discovery has hindered their rational discovery and development. This also left us inadequate knowledge on the rational design of covalent ligands, e.g., how to balance the contribution from the covalent group and the noncovalent group, respectively. In this work, we dissected the noncovalent docking from covalent docking by creating SCARs (steric-clashes alleviating receptors). We showed that the SCAR method outperformed those specifically developed but more complicated covalent docking protocols. We furthermore provided a ""proof-of-principle"" example by implementing this method in the first high-throughput screening and discovery of novel covalent inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. This work demonstrated that noncovalent groups play a predeterminate role in the design of covalent ligands, and would be of great value in accelerating the discovery and development of covalent ligands.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2016
25914208,Generated 3D-common feature hypotheses using the HipHop method for developing new topoisomerase I inhibitors.,"The continued interest in designing novel topoisomerase I (Topo I) inhibitors and the lack of adequate ligand-based computer-aided drug discovery efforts combined with the drawbacks of structure-based design prompted us to explore the possibility of developing ligand-based three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore(s). This approach avoids the pitfalls of structure-based techniques because it only focuses on common features among known ligands; furthermore, the pharmacophore model can be used as 3D search queries to discover new Topo I inhibitory scaffolds. In this article, we employed the HipHop module using Discovery Studio to construct plausible binding hypotheses for clinically used Topo I inhibitors, such as camptothecin, topotecan, belotecan, and SN-38, which is an active metabolite of irinotecan. The docked pose of topotecan was selected as a reference compound. The first hypothesis (Hypo 01) among the obtained 10 hypotheses was chosen for further analysis. Hypo 01 had six features, which were two hydrogen-bond acceptors, one hydrogen-bond donor, one hydrophob aromatic and one hydrophob aliphatic, and one ring aromatic. Our obtained hypothesis was checked by using some of the aromathecin derivatives which were published for their Topo I inhibitory potency. Moreover, five structures were found to be possible anti-Topo I compounds from the DruglikeDiverse database. From this research, it can be suggested that our model could be useful for further studies in order to design new potent Topo I-targeting antitumor drugs.",Archiv der Pharmazie,2015

25541527,"Exploration of the structural requirements of HIV-protease inhibitors using pharmacophore, virtual screening and molecular docking approaches for lead identification.","Pharmacoinformatics approaches are widely used in the field of drug discovery as it saves time, investment and animal sacrifice. In the present study, pharmacore-based virtual screening was adopted to identify potential HIV-protease ligands as anti-HIV agents. Pharmacophore is the 3D orientation and spatial arrangement of functional groups that are critical for binding at the active site cavity. Virtual screening retrieves potential hit molecules from databases based on imposed criteria. A set of 30 compounds were selected with inhibition constant as training set from 129 compounds of dataset set and subsequently the pharmacophore model was developed. The selected best model consists of hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, hydrophobic and aromatic ring, features critical for HIV-protease inhibitors. The model exhibits high correlation (R=0.933), less rmsd (1.014), high cross validated correlation coefficient (Q(2)=0.872) among the ten models examined and validated by Fischer's randomization test at 95% confidence level. The acceptable parameters of test set prediction, such as R(pred)(2)=0.768 and r(m(test))(2)=0.711 suggested that external predictivity of the model was significant. The pharmacophore model was used to perform a virtual screening employing the NCI database. Initial hits were sorted using a number of parameters and finally seven compounds were proposed as potential HIV-protease molecules. One potential HIV-protease ligand is reportedly confirmed as an active agent for anti-HIV screening, validating the current approach. It can be postulated that the pharmacophore model facilitates the selection of novel scaffold of HIV-protease inhibitors and can also allow the design of new chemical entities.",Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2015

The present study focused on inhibiting the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine--N-acetylmuramyl-(pentapeptide)pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol N-acetylglucosamine transferase (MurG) enzyme, which is a key enzyme in peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway. A high throughput virtual screening was used to find possible lead molecules from Enamine -High-Throughput Screening Center library. The resulting high binding affinity ligands were further assessed for their drug-likeness and other pharmacokinetic properties. Based on these analyses, the three ligands Z95813755_1, Z324718246_1 and Z324718246_2 were selected for further molecular dynamic simulation studies. The molecular dynamic simulation results and MM/PBSA analysis predicted that both Z95813755_1 and Z324718246_2, molecules show higher binding affinity towards MurG. For the first time we are reporting potential candidate inhibitors against MurG from K. pneumoniae, providing new insights in management of multi drug resistant K. pneumoniae infections.",Research in microbiology,2025
33151166,"Identification of potential COVID-19 main protease inhibitors using structure-based pharmacophore approach, molecular docking and repurposing studies.","The current outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections urges the need to identify potential therapeutic agents. Therefore, the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs against today's diseases involves the use of de-risked compounds with potentially lower costs and shorter development timelines. In this study, the recently resolved X-ray crystallographic structure of COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) was used to generate a pharmacophore model and to conduct a docking study to capture antiviral drugs as new promising COVID-19 main protease inhibitors. The developed pharmacophore successfully captured five FDA-approved antiviral drugs (lopinavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, saquinavir and raltegravir). The five drugs were successfully docked into the binding site of COVID-19 Mpro and showed several specific binding interactions that were comparable to those tying the co-crystallized inhibitor X77 inside the binding site of COVID-19 Mpro. Three of the captured drugs namely, remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were reported to have promising results in COVID-19 treatment and therefore increases the confidence in our results. Our findings suggest an additional possible mechanism of action for remdesivir as an antiviral drug inhibiting COVID-19 Mpro. Additionally, a combination of structure-based pharmacophore modeling with a docking study is expected to facilitate the discovery of novel COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors.","Acta pharmaceutica (Zagreb, Croatia)",2021
35759452,Death-Associated Protein Kinase 3 Inhibitors Identified by Virtual Screening for Drug Discovery in Cancer and Hypertension.,"Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates apoptosis, autophagy, transcription, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. DAPK3 induces morphological alterations in apoptosis when overexpressed, and it is considered a potential drug target in antihypertensive and anticancer drug development. In this article, we report new findings from a structure-guided virtual screening for discovery of phytochemicals that could modulate the elevated expression of DAPK3, and with an eye to anticancer drug discovery. We used the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT), a curated database, as part of the methodology. The potential initial hits were identified based on their physicochemical properties and binding affinity toward DAPK3. Subsequently, various filters for drug likeness followed by interaction analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 100 nsec were performed to explore the conformational sampling and stability of DAPK3 with the candidate molecules. Notably, the data from all-atom MD simulations and principal component analysis suggested that DAPK3 forms stable complexes with ketanserin and rotenone. In conclusion, this study supports the idea that ketanserin and rotenone bind to DAPK3, and show stability, which can be further explored as promising scaffolds in drug development and therapeutics innovation in clinical contexts such as hypertension and various types of cancer.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2022
33759121,Binding Mode Prediction and Virtual Screening Applications by Covalent Docking.,"The mechanism of action of covalent drugs involves the formation of a bond between their electrophilic warhead group and a nucleophilic residue of the protein target. The recent advances in covalent drug discovery have accelerated the development of computational tools for the design and characterization of covalent binders. Covalent docking algorithms can predict the binding mode of covalent ligands by modeling the bonds and interactions formed at the reaction site. Their scoring functions can estimate the relative binding affinity of ligands towards the target of interest, thus allowing virtual screening of compound libraries. However, most of the scoring schemes have no specific terms for the bond formation, and therefore it prevents the direct comparison of warheads with different intrinsic reactivity. Herein, we describe a protocol for the binding mode prediction of covalent ligands, a typical virtual screening of compound sets with a single warhead chemistry, and an alternative approach to screen libraries that include various warhead types, as applied in recently validated studies.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2021

Subsequent molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area free-energy calculations for the five ligand-HIV PR complexes suggested a high stability of the systems through hydrogen-bond interactions between the ligands and the protease's flaps (Ile50/50'), as well as interactions with residues of the active site (Asp25/25'/29/29'/30/30'). Binding-energy calculations for the three most promising compounds yielded values between -5 and -10 kcal mol(-1) and suggested that van der Waals interactions contribute most favorably to the total energy.

32102234,Discovery of Small-Molecule Activators for Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) Using Machine Learning Approaches.,"Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic enzyme converting glucose-6-phosphate into 6-phosphogluconate in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The G6PD deficiency renders the inability to regenerate glutathione due to lack of Nicotine Adenosine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) and produces stress conditions that can cause oxidative injury to photoreceptors, retinal cells, and blood barrier function. In this study, we constructed pharmacophore-based models based on the complex of G6PD with compound AG1 (G6PD activator) followed by virtual screening. Fifty-three hit molecules were mapped with core pharmacophore features. We performed molecular descriptor calculation, clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to pharmacophore hit molecules and further applied statistical machine learning methods. Optimal performance of pharmacophore modeling and machine learning approaches classified the 53 hits as drug-like (18) and nondrug-like (35) compounds. The drug-like compounds further evaluated our established cheminformatics pipeline (molecular docking and in silico ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) analysis). Finally, five lead molecules with different scaffolds were selected by binding energies and in silico ADMET properties. This study proposes that the combination of machine learning methods with traditional structure-based virtual screening can effectively strengthen the ability to find potential G6PD activators used for G6PD deficiency diseases. Moreover, these compounds can be considered as safe agents for further validation studies at the cell level, animal model, and even clinic setting.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020

We have developed a data-driven optimization protocol, which integrates mutational data and structural information from multiple X-ray receptor structures in combination with a fully flexible ligand docking protocol to determine the binding conformation of AR231453, a small-molecule agonist, in the GPR119 receptor. Resulting models converge to one conformation that explains the majority of data from mutation studies and is consistent with the structure-activity relationship for a large number of AR231453 analogs. Another key property of the refined models is their success in separating active ligands from decoys in a large-scale virtual screening. These results demonstrate that mutation-guided receptor modeling can provide predictions of practical value for describing receptor-ligand interactions and drug discovery.","Structure (London, England : 1993)",2015

This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by impaired memory and progressive decline in cognitive function. BACE1, a transmembrane protein found in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, exhibits varying levels across different neural subtypes. Abnormal BACE1 activity in the brains of individuals with AD leads to the formation of beta-amyloid proteins. The complex interplay between myelin sheath formation, BACE1 activity, and beta-amyloid accumulation suggests a critical role in understanding the pathological mechanisms of AD. The primary objective of this study was to identify molecular inhibitors that target Abeta. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was employed using the MCULE database, which houses over 2 million chemical compounds. A total of 59 molecules were selected after the toxicity profiling. Subsequently, five compounds conforming to the Egan-Egg permeation predictive model of the ADME rules were selected and subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock Vina on the Mcule drug discovery platform.

However, till now, the molecular mechanism of up-regulation still remained unclear. In this study, an integrated approach that combined serum ABCA1 in vivo assay, QSAR modeling and molecular docking was developed to explore the molecular mechanism and chemical substance basis of WDD upregulating HDL-c levels. Compared with Mets model group, serum ABCA1 and HDL-c levels intervened by two different doses of WDD for two weeks were significantly up-regulated. Then, kohonen and LDA were applied to develop QSAR models for ABCA1 up-regulators based flavonoids. The derived QSAR model produced the overall accuracy of 100%, a very powerful tool for screening ABCA1 up-regulators. The QSAR model prediction revealed 67 flavonoids in WDD were ABCA1 up-regulators. Finally, they were subjected to the molecular docking to understand their roles in up-regulating ABCA1 expression, which led to discovery of 23 ABCA1 up-regulators targeting LXR beta.

37480347,How Good Are Current Docking Programs at Nucleic Acid-Ligand Docking? A Comprehensive Evaluation.,"Nucleic acid (NA)-ligand interactions are of paramount importance in a variety of biological processes, including cellular reproduction and protein biosynthesis, and therefore, NAs have been broadly recognized as potential drug targets. Understanding NA-ligand interactions at the atomic scale is essential for investigating the molecular mechanism and further assisting in NA-targeted drug discovery. Molecular docking is one of the predominant computational approaches for predicting the interactions between NAs and small molecules. Despite the availability of versatile docking programs, their performance profiles for NA-ligand complexes have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we first compiled the largest structure-based NA-ligand binding data set to date, containing 800 noncovalent NA-ligand complexes with clearly identified ligands. Based on this extensive data set, eight frequently used docking programs, including six protein-ligand docking programs (LeDock, Surflex-Dock, UCSF Dock6, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and PLANTS) and two specific NA-ligand docking programs (rDock and RLDOCK), were systematically evaluated in terms of binding pose and binding affinity predictions. The results demonstrated that some protein-ligand docking programs, specifically PLANTS and LeDock, produced more promising or comparable results compared with the specialized NA-ligand docking programs. Among the programs evaluated, PLANTS, rDock, and LeDock showed the highest performance in binding pose prediction, and their top-1 and best root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) success rates were as follows: PLANTS (35.93 and 76.05%), rDock (27.25 and 72.16%), and LeDock (27.40 and 64.37%). Compared with the moderate level of binding pose prediction, few programs were successful in binding affinity prediction, and the best correlation (R(p) = -0.461) was observed with PLANTS. Finally, further comparison with the latest NA-ligand docking program (NLDock) on four well-established data sets revealed that PLANTS and LeDock outperformed NLDock in terms of binding pose prediction on all data sets, demonstrating their significant potential for NA-ligand docking. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive evaluation of popular molecular docking programs for NA-ligand systems.",Journal of chemical theory and computation,2023

35724476,Articulating target-mining techniques to disinter Alzheimer's specific targets for drug repurposing.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), an extremely progressive neurodegenerative disorder is an amalgamation of numerous intricate pathological networks. This century old disease is still an unmet medical condition owing to the modest efficacy of existing therapeutic agents in antagonizing the multi-targeted pathological pathways underlying AD. Given the paucity in AD specific drugs, fabricating comprehensive research strategies to envision disease specific targets to channelize and expedite drug discovery are mandated. However, the dwindling approval rates and stringent regulatory constraints concerning the approval of a new chemical entity is daunting the pharmaceutical industries from effectuating de novo research. To bridge the existing gaps in AD drug research, a promising contemporary way out could be drug repurposing. This drug repurposing investigation is intended to envisage AD specific targets and create drug libraries pertinent to the shortlisted targets via a series of avant-garde bioinformatics and computational strategies. METHODS: Transcriptomic analysis of three AD specific datasets viz., GSE122063, GSE15222 and GSE5281 revealed significant Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and subsequent Protein-Protein Interactions (PPI) network analysis captured crucial AD targets. Later, homology model was constructed through I-TASSER for a shortlisted target protein which lacked X-ray crystallographic structure and the built protein model was validated by molecular dynamic simulations. Further, drug library was created for the shortlisted target based on structural and side effect similarity with respective standard drugs. Finally, molecular docking, binding energy calculations and molecular dynamics studies were carried out to unravel the interactions exhibited by drugs from the created library with amino acids in active binding pocket of RGS4. RESULTS: SST and RGS4 were shortlisted as potentially significant AD specific targets, however, the less explored target RGS4 was considered for further sequential analysis. Homology model constructed for RGS4 displayed best quality when validated through Ramachandran plot and ERRAT plot. Subsequent docking and molecular dynamics studies showcased substantial affinity demonstrated by three drugs viz., Ziprasidone, Melfoquine and Metaxalone from the created drug libraries, towards RGS4. CONCLUSION: This virtual analysis forecasted the repurposable potential of Ziprasidone, Melfoquine and Metaxalone against AD based on their affinity towards RGS4, a key AD-specific target.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2022

But, accurate prediction of the binding structures of protein-ligand is still a major challenge for molecular docking methods. Herein, we developed molecular docking with conformer-dependent charges (MDCC), a docking method to combine conformational search with RESP charges. Compared to the conventional Glide SP method (51.9%) and Glide XP method (52.6%), the MDCC method (60%) exhibited a higher docking success rate based on 285 protein-small molecule ligand complexes from the PDBbind core set. And when the ligand met one of the conditions (the total hydrophobic surface area > 438, the number of hydrophobic atoms > 10, and molecular weight > 235), the docking success rate of the MDCC method (>90%) was higher than that of the Glide SP method ( approximately 72%). Furthermore, we also applied the MDCC method to predict the protein-ligand interactions in GPCR Dock 2021 competition, with our prediction models ranking 2nd out of all 202 participating models for APJ and 5th out of all 193 participating models for GPR139, demonstrating the relatively high docking accuracy of the MDCC method.

37882338,Deep Learning with Geometry-Enhanced Molecular Representation for Augmentation of Large-Scale Docking-Based Virtual Screening.,"Structure-based virtual screening has been a crucial tool in drug discovery for decades. However, as the chemical space expands, the existing structure-based virtual screening techniques based on molecular docking and scoring struggle to handle billion-entry ultralarge libraries due to the high computational cost. To address this challenge, people have resorted to machine learning techniques to enhance structure-based virtual screening for efficiently exploring the vast chemical space. In those cases, compounds are usually treated as sequential strings or two-dimensional topology graphs, limiting their ability to incorporate three-dimensional structural information for downstream tasks. We herein propose a novel deep learning protocol, GEM-Screen, which utilizes the geometry-enhanced molecular representation of the compounds docking to a specific target and is trained on docking scores of a small fraction of a library through an active learning strategy to approximate the docking outcome for yet nontraining entries. This protocol is applied to virtual screening campaigns against the AmpC and D4 targets, demonstrating that GEM-Screen enriches more than 90% of the hit scaffolds for AmpC in the top 4% of model predictions and more than 80% of the hit scaffolds for D4 in the same top-ranking size of library. GEM-Screen can be used in conjunction with traditional docking programs for docking of only the top-ranked compounds to avoid the exhaustive docking of the whole library, thus allowing for discovering top-scoring compounds from billion-entry libraries in a rapid yet accurate fashion.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2023

29243930,Structure-Based Kinase Profiling To Understand the Polypharmacological Behavior of Therapeutic Molecules.,"Several drugs elicit their therapeutic efficacy by modulating multiple cellular targets and possess varied polypharmacological actions. The identification of the molecular targets of a potent bioactive molecule is essential in determining its overall polypharmacological profile. Experimental procedures are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, computational approaches are actively implemented in rational drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate a computational pipeline, based on reverse virtual screening technique using several consensus scoring strategies, and perform structure-based kinase profiling of 12 FDA-approved drugs. This target prediction showed an overall good performance, with an average AU-ROC greater than 0.85 for most drugs, and identified the true targets even at the top 2% cutoff. In contrast, 10 non-kinase binder drugs exhibited lower binding efficiency and appeared in the bottom of ranking list. Subsequently, we validated this pipeline on a potent therapeutic molecule, mahanine, whose polypharmacological profile related to targeting kinases is unknown. Our target-prediction method identified different kinases. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated that mahanine is able to modulate multiple kinases that are involved in cross-talk with different signaling molecules, which thereby exhibits its polypharmacological action. More importantly, in vitro kinase assay exhibited the inhibitory effect of mahanine on two such predicted kinases' (mTOR and VEGFR2) activity, with IC(50) values being  approximately 12 and  approximately 22 muM, respectively. Next, we generated a comprehensive drug-protein interaction fingerprint that explained the basis of their target selectivity.

39413401,Navigating Ultralarge Virtual Chemical Spaces with Product-of-Experts Chemical Language Models.,"Ultralarge virtual chemical spaces have emerged as a valuable resource for drug discovery, providing access to billions of make-on-demand compounds with high synthetic success rates. Chemical language models can potentially accelerate the exploration of these vast spaces through direct compound generation. However, existing models are not designed to navigate specific virtual chemical spaces and often overlook synthetic accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce product-of-experts (PoE) chemical language models, a modular and scalable approach to navigating ultralarge virtual chemical spaces. This method allows for controlled compound generation within a desired chemical space by combining a prior model pretrained on the target space with expert and anti-expert models fine-tuned using external property-specific data sets. We demonstrate that the PoE chemical language model can generate compounds with desirable properties, such as those that favorably dock to dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) and are predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), while ensuring that the majority of generated compounds are present within the target chemical space. Our results highlight the potential of chemical language models for navigating ultralarge virtual chemical spaces, and we anticipate that this study will motivate further research in this direction.

34157284,A novel inhibitor L755507 efficiently blocks c-Myc-MAX heterodimerization and induces apoptosis in cancer cells.,"c-Myc is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis, and its deregulation is associated with highly aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant cancers. After binding with partner MAX, the c-Myc-MAX heterodimer regulates the expression of several genes, leading to an oncogenic phenotype. Although considered a crucial therapeutic target, no clinically approved c-Myc-targeted therapy has yet been discovered. Here, we report the discovery via computer-aided drug discovery of a small molecule, L755507, which functions as a c-Myc inhibitor to efficiently restrict the growth of diverse Myc-expressing cells with low micromolar IC(50) values. L755507 successfully disrupts the c-Myc-MAX heterodimer, resulting in decreased expression of c-Myc target genes. Spectroscopic and computational experiments demonstrated that L755507 binds to the c-Myc peptide and thereby stabilizes the helix-loop-helix conformation of the c-Myc transcription factor. Taken together, this study suggests that L755507 effectively inhibits the c-Myc-MAX heterodimerization and may be used for further optimization to develop a c-Myc-targeted antineoplastic drug.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2021

The discovery of ABCG2 inhibitors could assist in designing unprecedented therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. There is as yet no approved drug targeting ABCG2, although a large number of drug candidates have been clinically investigated. In this work, binding affinities of 181 drug candidates in clinical-trial or investigational stages as ABCG2 inhibitors were inspected using in silico techniques. Based on available experimental data, the performance of AutoDock4.2.6 software was first validated to predict the inhibitor-ABCG2 binding mode and affinity. Combined molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) binding energy calculations, were then performed to filter out the studied drug candidates. From the estimated docking scores and MM-GBSA binding energies, six auspicious drug candidates-namely, pibrentasvir, venetoclax, ledipasvir, avatrombopag, cobicistat, and revefenacin-exhibited auspicious binding energies with value < -70.0 kcal/mol. Interestingly, pibrentasvir, venetoclax, and ledipasvir were observed to show even higher binding affinities with the ABCG2 transporter with binding energies of < -80.0 kcal/mol over long MD simulations of 100 ns. The stabilities of these three promising candidates in complex with ABCG2 transporter were demonstrated by their energetics and structural analyses throughout the 100 ns MD simulations. The current study throws new light on pibrentasvir, venetoclax, and ledipasvir as curative options for multidrug resistant cancers by inhibiting ABCG2 transporter.",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,2021

DNA-encoded chemical libraries (DECLs) can nowadays yield hits with unprecedented ease, and lead-optimization is becoming the limiting step. Here we integrate DECL screening with structure-based computational methods to streamline the development of lead compounds. The presented workflow consists of enumerating a virtual combinatorial library (VCL) derived from a DECL screening hit and using computational binding prediction to identify molecules with enhanced properties relative to the original DECL hit. As proof-of-concept demonstration, we applied this approach to identify an inhibitor of PARP10 that is more potent and druglike than the original DECL screening hit.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2020

In this investigation, the structure-based virtual screening methods, including molecular docking and rescoring, and similarity analysis of interaction molecular fingerprints, were developed to discover novel tubulin inhibitors from ChemDiv database with 1,601,806 compounds. The screened compounds were further filtered by PAINS, ADME/T, Toxscore, SAscore, and Drug-likeness analysis. Finally, 17 hit compounds were selected, and then submitted to the biologic evaluation. Among these hits, the P2 exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity against four tumor cells including HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, and A549. The in vitro tubulin polymerization assay revealed P2 could promote tubulin polymerization in a dose dependent manner. Finally, in order to analyze the interaction modes of complexes, the molecular dynamics simulation was performed to investigate the interactions between P2 and tubulin. The molecular dynamics simulation analysis showed that P2 could stably bind to taxane site, induced H6-H7, B9-B10, and M-loop regions changes. The DeltaG(bind) energies of tubulin-P2 and tubulin-paclitaxel were -68.25 +/- 12.98 and -146.05 +/- 16.17 kJ mol(-1), respectively, which were in line with the results of the experimental test.

These include correctly identifying ligand poses near and far from the true binding mode when given a set of reference receptors and classifying ligands as active or inactive using structural information. We use the CNN to re-score or refine poses generated using a conventional scoring function, Autodock Vina, and compare the performance of each of these methods to using the conventional scoring function alone. Furthermore, we assess several ways of choosing appropriate reference receptors in the context of the D3R 2017 community benchmarking challenge. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms Vina on most tasks without requiring manual inspection by a knowledgeable operator, but that the pose prediction target chosen for the challenge, Cathepsin S, was particularly challenging for de novo docking. However, the CNN provided best-in-class performance on several virtual screening tasks, underscoring the relevance of deep learning to the field of drug discovery.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2019
32638150,"Molecular basis of the beta-lactamase protein using comparative modelling, drug screening and molecular dynamics studies to understand the resistance of beta-lactam antibiotics.","Beta-lactamase (ampC) in general causes the onset of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria against the beta-lactam antibiotics. Morganella morganii which belongs to the Proteae tribe of the Enterobacteriaceae family is a Gram-negative bacillus. Gram-negative bacteria are the key problematic agents among the human population in overexpressing resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. These beta-lactam antibiotics being experimentally well studied still lack the key information and mechanism for their resistance. The structural information of the ampC protein is unknown and poorly studied; hence, it is the need of the hour to find effective inhibitors against it. In our study, the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of ampC protein from Morganella morganii was performed using a comparative modelling approach. The predicted structure was energetically stabilized and functional conformations were mapped through 100-ns molecular dynamics simulation runs. Also, Ramachandran plot shows the model to be stereo-chemically stable with most residues found under core allowed regions. Drug screening with several experimentally tested inhibitors was then confirmed to check the activity against ampC protein using an AutoDock tool. The results suggested OncoglabrinolC molecule as the best inhibitor (out of 21 drug molecules) with a binding affinity of - 11.44 kcal/mol. Anti-bacterial/anti-parasitic inhibitors have not only been used against bacterial infections, but later reports have also shown them to work against deadly viruses such as SARS-CoV2. This key structural and inhibitory information is certain to help in the discovery of specific and potent substitute therapeutic drugs and the development of experimental procedures against human infection.",Journal of molecular modeling,2020
37110655,Virtual Screening Strategy to Identify Retinoic Acid-Related Orphan Receptor gammat Modulators.,"Molecular docking is a key method used in virtual screening (VS) campaigns to identify small-molecule ligands for drug discovery targets. While docking provides a tangible way to understand and predict the protein-ligand complex formation, the docking algorithms are often unable to separate active ligands from inactive molecules in practical VS usage. Here, a novel docking and shape-focused pharmacophore VS protocol is demonstrated for facilitating effective hit discovery using retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORgammat) as a case study. RORgammat is a prospective target for treating inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. First, a commercial molecular database was flexibly docked. Second, the alternative docking poses were rescored against the shape/electrostatic potential of negative image-based (NIB) models that mirror the target's binding cavity. The compositions of the NIB models were optimized via iterative trimming and benchmarking using a greedy search-driven algorithm or brute force NIB optimization. Third, a pharmacophore point-based filtering was performed to focus the hit identification on the known RORgammat activity hotspots. Fourth, free energy binding affinity evaluation was performed on the remaining molecules. Finally, twenty-eight compounds were selected for in vitro testing and eight compounds were determined to be low muM range RORgammat inhibitors, thereby showing that the introduced VS protocol generated an effective hit rate of ~29%.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023

Autophagy plays a role in maintaining the survival of cancer cells and might mediate resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Herein, a new series of 5-amino-2-ether-benzamide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as autophagy inhibitors. Selected from 14 synthesized compounds as lead autophagy inhibitor, N-(cyclohexylmethyl)-5-(((cyclohexylmethyl)amino)methyl)-2-((4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)oxy)benzamide (4 d) showed the most obvious effect of LC3B protein conversion. Further, its autophagy inhibition, evaluated by using transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, showed that the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes in the final stage of autophagic flux was suppressed. We also found that 4 d could enhance the chemosensitivity of vincristine in vincristine-resistant esophageal cancer cell line Eca109/VCR in a synergistic, associative manner. Moreover, a computational study showed that 4 d might bind with p62-zz to inhibit autophagy.

This study was undertaken to identify novel structurally diverse anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Pharmacophore hypotheses modeling, virtual screening and molecular docking were used to detect potential inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in this paper. RESULTS: After the generation of ten pharmacophore hypotheses, Hypo1 with the highest correlation value (0.981), lowest RMS (0.565), highest cost difference (83.850) along with four typical chemical features was regarded as the best hypothesis.

The structural modification of most currently available BRD4 inhibitors is relatively simple, but the drug effectiveness is limited. Research has found that the inhibition of BD1 may promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; however, the inhibition of BD2 will not cause this outcome. Therefore, newly potential drugs which target BRD4-BD2 need further research. Herein, we initially built QSAR models out of 49 compounds using HQSAR, CoMFA, CoMSIA, and Topomer CoMFA technology. All of the models have shown suitable reliabilities (q(2) = 0.778, 0.533, 0.640, 0.702, respectively) and predictive abilities (r(2)(pred) = 0.716, 0.6289, 0.6153, 0.7968, respectively) for BRD4-BD2 inhibitors. On the basis of QSAR results and the search of the R-group in the topomer search module, we designed 20 new compounds with high activity that showed appropriate docking score and suitable ADMET. Docking studies and MD simulation were carried out to reveal the amino acid residues (Asn351, Cys347, Tyr350, Pro293, and Asp299) at the active site of BRD4-BD2. Free energy calculations and free energy landscapes verified the stable binding results and indicated stable conformations of the complexes.

37897186,Theoretical investigation on known renin inhibitors and generation of ligand-based pharmacophore models for hypertension treatment.,"The renin enzyme is considered a promising target for hypertension and renal diseases. Over the last three decades, several experimental and theoretical studies have been engaged in the discovery of potent renin inhibitors. The identified inhibitors that undergo clinical trials are still failing to meet the criteria of potency and safety. To date, there is no specific FDA-approved drug for renin inhibition. Our theoretical opinion describes that the most potent compounds identified in experimental studies but lacking safety and overdose issues could be solved by finding similar molecules that are stable, very active, and have no side effects, which will kick start the drug discovery process. Here, we utilized the most potent direct renin inhibitors reported earlier, followed further by our theoretical study reported in 2019. Ligand-based virtual screening, density functional theory, and dynamic simulation studies were employed to explore the identified compounds and co-crystallized molecule in the protein structure. From the diverse databases, we have identified several identical molecules based on their structural features, such as functional groups like hydrophobic (H), aromatic rings (R), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), and donor (D). The HHHPR five-point pharmacophore feature was identified as a template pharmacophore to search the potential compounds from the Enamine and LifeChemical databases and have a good fitness score with known renin inhibitors. Furthermore, theoretical validation was done through several studies that confirmed the activity of the identified molecules. Overall, we propose that these compounds might break the failure in adverse events and improve the potency of hypertension treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The lack of a vaccine for leishmaniasis coupled with the limitations of existing anti-leishmanial therapies prompted this study. Cheminformatic techniques are widely used in screening large libraries of compounds, studying protein-ligand interactions, analysing pharmacokinetic properties, and designing new drug molecules with great speed, accuracy, and precision. This study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-leishmanial potential of some organoselenium compounds by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, molecular docking, pharmacokinetic analysis, and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The built QSAR model was validated (R(2)(train) = 0.8646, R(2)(test) = 0.8864, Q(2) = 0.5773) and the predicted inhibitory activity (pIC(50)) values of the newly designed compounds were higher than that of the template (Compound 6). The new analogues (6a, 6b, and 6c) showed good binding interactions with the target protein (Pyridoxal kinase, PdxK) while also presenting excellent drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic profiles. The results of density functional theory, MD simulation, and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) analyses suggest the favourability and stability of protein-ligand interactions of the new analogues with PdxK, comparing favourably well with the reference drug (Pentamidine).

In the current study, the Natural Products Atlas (NPAtlas) database was mined to hunt potential SIRT2 inhibitors utilizing in silico techniques. Initially, the performance of the employed docking protocol to anticipate ligand-SIRT2 binding mode was assessed according to the accessible experimental data. Based on the predicted docking scores, the most promising NPAtlas molecules were selected and submitted to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by binding energy computations. Based on the MM-GBSA binding energy estimations over a 200 ns MD course, three NPAtlas compounds, namely NPA009578, NPA006805, and NPA001884, were identified with better DeltaG(binding) towards SIRT2 protein than the native ligand (SirReal2) with values of - 59.9, - 57.4, - 53.5, and - 49.7 kcal/mol, respectively. On the basis of structural and energetic assessments, the identified NPAtlas compounds were confirmed to be steady over a 200 ns MD course.

37386792,DSDP: A Blind Docking Strategy Accelerated by GPUs.,"Virtual screening, including molecular docking, plays an essential role in drug discovery. Many traditional and machine-learning-based methods are available to fulfill the docking task. However, the traditional docking methods are normally extensively time-consuming, and their performance in blind docking remains to be improved. Although the runtime of docking based on machine learning is significantly decreased, their accuracy is still limited. In this study, we take advantage of both traditional and machine-learning-based methods and present a method, deep site and docking pose (DSDP), to improve the performance of blind docking. For traditional blind docking, the entire protein is covered by a cube, and the initial positions of ligands are randomly generated in this cube. In contrast, DSDP can predict the binding site of proteins and provide an accurate searching shape and initial positions for further conformational sampling. The sampling task of DSDP makes use of the score function and a similar but modified searching strategy of AutoDock Vina, accelerated by implementation in GPUs. We systematically compare its performance in redocking, blind docking, and virtual screening tasks with state-of-the-art methods, including AutoDock Vina, GNINA, QuickVina, SMINA, and DiffDock. In the blind docking task, DSDP reaches a 29.8% top-1 success rate (root-mean-squared deviation < 2 A) on an unbiased and challenging test dataset with 1.2 s wall-clock computational time per system. Its performances on the DUD-E dataset and the time-split PDBBind dataset used in EquiBind, TANKBind, and DiffDock are also evaluated, presenting a 57.2 and 41.8% top-1 success rate with 0.8 and 1.0 s per system, respectively.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2023

Utilizing the MTiOpenScreen web server, we screened for compounds that exhibit favorable interactions with ALK, resulting in 1227 compounds with virtual screening scores ranging from - 10.2 to - 3.7 kcal/mol. Subsequent re-docking of three selected compounds (ZINC000059779788, ZINC000043552589, and ZINC000003594862) and one reference compound against ALK yielded docking scores - 10.4, - 10.2, - 10.2, and - 10.1 kcal/mol, respectively. These compounds demonstrated promising interactions with ALK, suggesting potential inhibitory effects. Advanced analyses, including MD simulation and binding free energy calculations, further supported the potential efficacy of these compounds. MD simulations, particularly the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analyses, revealed that compounds ZINC000059779788 and ZINC000003594862 achieved better stability compared to compound ZINC000043552589. These stable conformations suggest effective binding over time. Free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA method showed that ZINC000059779788 had the most favorable binding energy, indicating a strong and stable interaction with the ALK protein. The promising computational findings from this study emphasize the necessity for additional experimental testing to verify the therapeutic efficacy of these natural compounds for treating lung cancers.",Molecular diversity,2025
29286651,Predictive Power of Different Types of Experimental Restraints in Small Molecule Docking: A Review.,"Incorporating experimental restraints is a powerful method of increasing accuracy in computational protein small molecule docking simulations. Different algorithms integrate distinct forms of biochemical data during the docking and/or scoring stages. These so-called hybrid methods make use of receptor-based information such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) restraints or small molecule-based information such as structure-activity relationships (SARs). A third class of methods directly interrogates contacts between the protein receptor and the small molecule. This work reviews the current state of using such restraints in docking simulations, evaluates their feasibility across broad systems, and identifies potential areas of algorithm development.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2018

The number of cases in the world, especially India, have been increasing exponentially. The need of the hour is to assimilate as much data as possible to fast track the pipeline of bringing in new therapeutic tools against this fatal virus. In this brief communication, we aim to throw light on the various variants of the proteins involved heavily in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, namely Spike protein, ACE2, GRP78, TMPRSS2 and NSP-12. We also portray the molecular docking studies of these proteins with specific drugs that are currently being associated with the same. In our brief study, we come across a few key findings. First of all the combinations of the variants of spike protein and ACE2 binding show overall 25% unfavourable DeltaDeltaG. Second, NSP12 is the most mutation prone among all the NSPs of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the most common mutations are P323L and A97V. Third, we discovered the variants found in the Indian subpopulation that have greater binding with the currently investigated drugs.",Journal of genetics,2021
31347933,Discovery of new butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors via structure-based virtual screening.,"Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) plays an important role in the progression of the Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we used a structure-based virtual screening (VS) approach to discover new BChE inhibitors. A ligand database was filtered and docked to the BChE protein using Glide program. The outcome from VS was filtered and the top ranked hits were thoroughly examined for their fitting into the protein active site. Consequently, the best 38 hits were selected for in vitro testing using Ellman's method, and six of which showed inhibition activity for BChE. Interestingly, the most potent hit (Compound 4) exhibited inhibitory activity against the BChE enzyme in the low micromolar level with an IC50 value of 8.3 microM. Hits obtained from this work can act as a starting point for future SAR studies to discover new BChE inhibitors as anti-Alzheimer agents.",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019
28685695,Quantum-Mechanics Methodologies in Drug Discovery: Applications of Docking and Scoring in Lead Optimization.,"The development and application of quantum mechanics (QM) methodologies in computer- aided drug design have flourished in the last 10 years. Despite the natural advantage of QM methods to predict binding affinities with a higher level of theory than those methods based on molecular mechanics (MM), there are only a few examples where diverse sets of protein-ligand targets have been evaluated simultaneously. In this work, we review recent advances in QM docking and scoring for those cases in which a systematic analysis has been performed. In addition, we introduce and validate a simplified QM/MM expression to compute protein-ligand binding energies. Overall, QMbased scoring functions are generally better to predict ligand affinities than those based on classical mechanics. However, the agreement between experimental activities and calculated binding energies is highly dependent on the specific chemical series considered. The advantage of more accurate QM methods is evident in cases where charge transfer and polarization effects are important, for example when metals are involved in the binding process or when dispersion forces play a significant role as in the case of hydrophobic or stacking interactions.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2017
32152607,An open-source drug discovery platform enables ultra-large virtual screens.,"On average, an approved drug currently costs US$2-3 billion and takes more than 10 years to develop(1). In part, this is due to expensive and time-consuming wet-laboratory experiments, poor initial hit compounds and the high attrition rates in the (pre-)clinical phases. Structure-based virtual screening has the potential to mitigate these problems. With structure-based virtual screening, the quality of the hits improves with the number of compounds screened(2). However, despite the fact that large databases of compounds exist, the ability to carry out large-scale structure-based virtual screening on computer clusters in an accessible, efficient and flexible manner has remained difficult. Here we describe VirtualFlow, a highly automated and versatile open-source platform with perfect scaling behaviour that is able to prepare and efficiently screen ultra-large libraries of compounds. VirtualFlow is able to use a variety of the most powerful docking programs. Using VirtualFlow, we prepared one of the largest and freely available ready-to-dock ligand libraries, with more than 1.4 billion commercially available molecules. To demonstrate the power of VirtualFlow, we screened more than 1 billion compounds and identified a set of structurally diverse molecules that bind to KEAP1 with submicromolar affinity. One of the lead inhibitors (iKeap1) engages KEAP1 with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant (K(d)) = 114 nM) and disrupts the interaction between KEAP1 and the transcription factor NRF2. This illustrates the potential of VirtualFlow to access vast regions of the chemical space and identify molecules that bind with high affinity to target proteins.",Nature,2020
37033493,Anti-viral drug discovery against monkeypox and smallpox infection by natural curcumin derivatives: A Computational drug design approach.,"BACKGROUND: In the last couple of years, viral infections have been leading the globe, considered one of the most widespread and extremely damaging health problems and one of the leading causes of mortality in the modern period. Although several viral infections are discovered, such as SARS CoV-2, Langya Henipavirus, there have only been a limited number of discoveries of possible antiviral drug, and vaccine that have even received authorization for the protection of human health. Recently, another virial infection is infecting worldwide (Monkeypox, and Smallpox), which concerns pharmacists, biochemists, doctors, and healthcare providers about another epidemic. Also, currently no specific treatment is available against Monkeypox. This research gap encouraged us to develop a new molecule to fight against monkeypox and smallpox disease. So, firstly, fifty different curcumin derivatives were collected from natural sources, which are available in the PubChem database, to determine antiviral capabilities against Monkeypox and Smallpox. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Preliminarily, the molecular docking experiment of fifty different curcumin derivatives were conducted, and the majority of the substances produced the expected binding affinities. Then, twelve curcumin derivatives were picked up for further analysis based on the maximum docking score. After that, the density functional theory (DFT) was used to determine chemical characterizations such as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), softness, and hardness, etc. RESULTS: The mentioned derivatives demonstrated docking scores greater than 6.80 kcal/mol, and the most significant binding affinity was at -8.90 kcal/mol, even though 12 molecules had higher binding scores (-8.00 kcal/mol to -8.9 kcal/mol), and better than the standard medications. The molecular dynamic simulation is described by root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), demonstrating that all the compounds might be stable in the physiological system. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, each derivative of curcumin has outstanding absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characteristics. Hence, we recommended the aforementioned curcumin derivatives as potential antiviral agents for the treatment of Monkeypox and Smallpox virus, and more in vivo investigations are warranted to substantiate our findings.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023
39026118,Argonaute protein assisted drug discovery for miRNA-181c-5p and target gene ATM translation repression: a computational approach.,"The miRNA binds to AGO's seed region, prompting the exploration of small molecules that can offset miRNA repression of target mRNA. This miRNA-181c-5p was found to be upregulated in the chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a prevalent neurodegenerative disease in contact sports and military personals. The research aimed to identify compounds that disrupt the AGO-assisted loop formation between miRNA-181c-5p and ATM, consequently repressing the translation of ATM. Target genes from commonly three databases (DIANA-microT-CDS, miRDB, RNA22 and TargetScan) were subjected to functional annotation and clustering analysis using DAVID bioinformatics tool. Haddock server were employed to make miRNA-181c-5p:ATM-AGO complex. A total of 2594 small molecules were screened using Glide XP based on their highest binding affinity towards the complex, through a three-phase docking approach. The top 5 compounds (DB00674-Galantamine, DB00371-Meprobamate, DB00694-Daunorubicin, DB00837-Progabide, and DB00851-Dacarbazine) were further analyzed for stability in the miRNA-181c-5p:ATM-AGO-ligand complex interaction using GROMACS (version 2023.2). Hence, these findings suggest that these molecules hold potential for facilitating AGO-assisted repression of ATM gene translation.",Molecular diversity,2025

34214294,Discovery of new targeting agents against GAPDH receptor for antituberculosis drug delivery.,"OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a public health concern due to the emergence and evolution of multidrug-resistant strains. To overcome this issue, reinforcing the effectiveness of first line antituberculosis agents using targeted drug delivery approach is an option. Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GADPH), a common virulence factor found in the pathogenic microorganisms has recently been discovered on the cell-surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, allowing it to be used as a drug target for TB. This study aims to discover active small molecule(s) that target GAPDH and eventually enhance the delivery of antituberculosis drugs. METHODS: Ten ligands with reported in vitro and/or in vivo activities against GAPDH were evaluated for their binding interactions through molecular docking studies using AutoDock 4.2 program. The ligand with the best binding energy was then modified to produce 10 derivatives, which were redocked against GAPDH using previous protocols. BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2019 was used to explore the ligand-receptor interactions between the derivatives and GAPDH. RESULTS: Among the 10 ligands, curcumin, koningic acid and folic acid showed the best binding energies. Further analysis on the docking of two folic acid derivatives, F7 (gamma-[tert-butyl-N-(6-aminohexyl)]carbamatefolic acid) and F8 (folic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) showed that the addition of a bulky substituent at the carboxyl group of the glutamic acid subcomponent resulted in improved binding energy. CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid and the two derivatives F7 and F8 have huge potentials to be developed as targeting agents against the GAPDH receptor.

32380148,Alphavirus capsid protease inhibitors as potential antiviral agents for Chikungunya infection.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus and currently, no antiviral drug is available to combat it. Capsid protein (CP) of alphaviruses present at the N-terminus of the structural polyprotein possesses auto-proteolytic activity which is essential for initiating the structural polyprotein processing. We are reporting for the first time antiviral molecules targeting capsid proteolytic activity. Structure-assisted drug-repositioning identified three molecules: P1,P4-Di(adenosine-5') tetraphosphate (AP4), Eptifibatide acetate (EAC) and Paromomycin sulphate (PSU) as potential capsid protease inhibitors. A FRET-based proteolytic assay confirmed anti-proteolytic activity of these molecules. Additionally, in vitro cell-based antiviral studies showed that EAC, AP4, and PSU drastically stifled CHIKV at the post-entry step with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 4.01 muM, 10.66 muM and 22.91 muM; respectively. Interestingly, the inhibitors had no adverse effect on viral RNA synthesis and treatment of cells with inhibitors diminished levels of CP in virus-infected cells, which confirmed inhibition of capsid auto-proteolytic activity. In conclusion, the discovery of antiviral molecules targeting capsid protease demystifies the alphavirus capsid protease as a potential target for antiviral drug discovery.",Antiviral research,2020
37378817,"Assessing the performance of docking, FEP, and MM/GBSA methods on a series of KLK6 inhibitors.","Kallikrein 6 (KLK6) is an attractive drug target for the treatment of neurological diseases and for various cancers. Herein, we explore the accuracy and efficiency of different computational methods and protocols to predict the free energy of binding (DeltaG(bind)) for a series of 49 inhibitors of KLK6. We found that the performance of the methods varied strongly with the tested system. For only one of the three KLK6 datasets, the docking scores obtained with rDock were in good agreement (R(2) >/= 0.5) with experimental values of DeltaG(bind). A similar result was obtained with MM/GBSA (using the ff14SB force field) calculations based on single minimized structures. Improved binding affinity predictions were obtained with the free energy perturbation (FEP) method, with an overall MUE and RMSE of 0.53 and 0.68 kcal/mol, respectively.

35084171,EViS: An Enhanced Virtual Screening Approach Based on Pocket-Ligand Similarity.,"Virtual screening (VS) is a popular technology in drug discovery to identify a new scaffold of actives for a specific drug target, which can be classified into ligand-based and structure-based approaches. As the number of protein-ligand complex structures available in public databases increases, it would be possible to develop a template searching-based VS approach that utilizes such information. In this work, we proposed an enhanced VS approach, which is termed EViS, to integrate ligand docking, protein pocket template searching, and ligand template shape similarity calculation. A novel and simple PL-score to characterize local pocket-ligand template similarity was used to evaluate the screening compounds. Benchmark tests were performed on three datasets including DUDE, LIT-PCBA, and DEKOIS. EViS achieved the average enrichment factors (EFs) of 27.8 and 23.4 at a 1% cutoff for experimental and predicted structures on the widely used DUDE dataset, respectively. Detailed data analysis shows that EViS benefits from obtaining favorable ligand poses from docking and using such ligand geometric information to perform three-dimensional (3D) ligand similarity calculations, and the PL-score is efficient to screen compounds based on template searching in the protein-ligand structure database.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2022

33606912,Virtual screening FDA approved drugs against multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2.,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory disease, led to a global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality. Despite frenzied efforts in therapeutic development, there are currently no effective drugs for treatment, nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, is one of the most practical treatment options against the outbreak. In this study, we present a novel strategy for in silico molecular modeling screening for potential drugs that may interact with multiple main proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Targeting multiple viral proteins is a novel drug discovery concept in that it enables the potential drugs to act on different stages of the virus' life cycle, thereby potentially maximizing the drug potency. We screened 2631 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules against 4 key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 that are known as attractive targets for antiviral drug development. In total, we identified 29 drugs that could actively interact with 2 or more target proteins, with 5 drugs (avapritinib, bictegravir, ziprasidone, capmatinib, and pexidartinib) being common candidates for all 4 key host proteins and 3 of them possessing the desirable molecular properties. By overlaying docked positions of drug candidates onto individual host proteins, it has been further confirmed that the binding site conformations are conserved. The drugs identified in our screening provide potential guidance for experimental confirmation, such as in vitro molecular assays and in vivo animal testing, as well as incorporation into ongoing clinical studies.",Clinical and translational science,2021
29118096,The SGC beyond structural genomics: redefining the role of 3D structures by coupling genomic stratification with fragment-based discovery.,"The ongoing explosion in genomics data has long since outpaced the capacity of conventional biochemical methodology to verify the large number of hypotheses that emerge from the analysis of such data. In contrast, it is still a gold-standard for early phenotypic validation towards small-molecule drug discovery to use probe molecules (or tool compounds), notwithstanding the difficulty and cost of generating them. Rational structure-based approaches to ligand discovery have long promised the efficiencies needed to close this divergence; in practice, however, this promise remains largely unfulfilled, for a host of well-rehearsed reasons and despite the huge technical advances spearheaded by the structural genomics initiatives of the noughties. Therefore the current, fourth funding phase of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), building on its extensive experience in structural biology of novel targets and design of protein inhibitors, seeks to redefine what it means to do structural biology for drug discovery. We developed the concept of a Target Enabling Package (TEP) that provides, through reagents, assays and data, the missing link between genetic disease linkage and the development of usefully potent compounds. There are multiple prongs to the ambition: rigorously assessing targets' genetic disease linkages through crowdsourcing to a network of collaborating experts; establishing a systematic approach to generate the protocols and data that comprise each target's TEP; developing new, X-ray-based fragment technologies for generating high quality chemical matter quickly and cheaply; and exploiting a stringently open access model to build multidisciplinary partnerships throughout academia and industry. By learning how to scale these approaches, the SGC aims to make structures finally serve genomics, as originally intended, and demonstrate how 3D structures systematically allow new modes of druggability to be discovered for whole classes of targets.",Essays in biochemistry,2017

Overexpression of N-Myc protein in prostate cancer (PCa) leads to its transformation to advanced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) that currently has no approved treatments. N-Myc has a short half-life but acts as an NEPC stimulator when it is stabilized by forming a protective complex with Aurora A kinase (AURKA). Therefore, dual-inhibition of N-Myc and AURKA would be an attractive therapeutic avenue for NEPC. Following our computer-aided drug discovery approach, compounds exhibiting potent N-Myc specific inhibition and strong anti-proliferative activity against several N-Myc driven cell lines, were identified. Thereafter, we have developed dual inhibitors of N-Myc and AURKA through structure-based drug design approach by merging our novel N-Myc specific chemical scaffolds with fragments of known AURKA inhibitors. Favorable binding modes of the designed compounds to both N-Myc and AURKA target sites have been predicted by docking.

Homology searching for conserved binding site to the rifampicin drug and the functional analysis of rpoB gene were done. Multiple Sequence alignment analysis of rpoB was compared with that in E.coli - rpoB and M. tuberculosis - rpoB. Docking studies of Rifampicin - rpoB complex was also done for finding binding affinity. The results of computational studies showed that rifampicin is a potential drug for malaria.",Drug research,2023

30104863,Discovery of nonnucleoside inhibitors of polymerase from infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV).,"INTRODUCTION: Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) causes serious losses in several fish species of commercial interest. IPNV is a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus with a genome consisting of two segments A and B. Segment B codes for the VP1 protein, a non-canonical RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that can be found both in its free form and linked to the end of genomic RNA, an essential enzyme for IPNV replication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We take advantage of the knowledge over the allosteric binding site described on the surface of the thumb domain of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase to design new non-nucleoside inhibitors against the IPNV VP1 polymerase. RESULTS: Molecular docking techniques have been used to screen a chemical library of 23,760 compounds over a defined cavity in the surface of the thumb domain. Additional ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) filter criteria has been applied. CONCLUSION: We select two sets of 9 and 50 inhibitor candidates against the polymerases of HCV and IPNV, respectively. Two non-toxic compounds have been tested in vitro with antiviral capacity against IPNV Sp and LWVRT60 strains in the low microM range with different activity depending on the IPNV strain used.","Drug design, development and therapy",2018

To identify novel and effective LRRK2 inhibitors, an ensemble virtual screening strategy by combining fingerprint similarity, complex-based pharmacophore and structure-based molecular docking was proposed and applied. Using this strategy, we finally selected 25 compounds from  approximately 1.7 million compounds for in vitro and in vivo tests. Firstly, the kinase inhibitory activity tests of compounds based on ADP-Glo assay identified three most potent compounds LY2023-19, LY2023-24 and LY2023-25 with IC(50) of 556.4 nM, 218.1 nM and 22.4 nM for LRRK2 G2019S mutant, respectively. The further cellular experiments also indicated that three hit compounds significantly inhibited Ser935 phosphorylation of both wide-type and G2019S LRRK2 with IC(50) ranging from 27 nM to 1674 nM in HEK293T cells. The MD simulations of three compounds and G2019S LRRK2 showed the hydrogen bond formed by Glu1948 and Ala1950 is crucial for the binding of LRRK2. Afterwards, 6-OHDA-induced PD zebrafish model was constructed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of hit compounds. The locomotion of the 6-OHDA treated zebrafish larvae was improved after treatment with LY2023-24.

The increasing resistance to existing antibiotics and their limited efficacy underscores the urgent need to identify new antibacterial agents with low toxicity to effectively combat various S. aureus infections. Hence, in this study, we have screened T-muurolol for possible interactions with several S. aureus-specific bacterial proteins to establish its potential as an alternative antibacterial agent. Based on its binding affinity and interactions with amino acids, T-muurolol was identified as a potential inhibitor of S. aureus lipase, dihydrofolate reductase, penicillin-binding protein 2a, D-Ala:D-Ala ligase, and ribosome protection proteins tetracycline resistance determinant (RPP TetM), which indicates its potentiality against S. aureus and its multi-drug-resistant strains. Also, T-muurolol exhibited good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity by showing strong binding interactions with flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase, and cyclooxygenase-2. Consequently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and recalculating binding free energies elucidated its binding interaction stability with targeted proteins. Furthermore, quantum chemical structure analysis based on density functional theory (DFT) depicted a higher energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E(HOMO-LUMO)) with a lower chemical potential index, and moderate electrophilicity suggests its chemical hardness and stability and less polarizability and reactivity. Additionally, pharmacological parameters based on ADMET, Lipinski's rules, and bioactivity score validated it as a promising drug candidate with high activity toward ion channel modulators, nuclear receptor ligands, and enzyme inhibitors. In conclusion, the current findings suggest T-muurolol as a promising alternative antibacterial agent that might be a potential phytochemical-based drug against S. aureus.

Over the years, docking protocols and scoring functions for protein-ligand complexes have evolved to improve the accuracy in the computation of binding strengths and poses. In the past decade, RNA has also emerged as a target class for new small-molecule drugs. However, most ligand docking programs have been validated and tested for proteins and not RNA. Here, we test the docking power (pose prediction accuracy) of three state-of-the-art docking protocols on 173 RNA-small molecule crystal structures. The programs are AutoDock4 (AD4) and AutoDock Vina (Vina), which were designed for protein targets, and rDock, which was designed for both protein and nucleic acid targets. AD4 performed relatively poorly. For RNA targets for which a crystal structure of a bound ligand used to limit the docking search space is available and for which the goal is to identify new molecules for the same pocket, rDock performs slightly better than Vina, with success rates of 48% and 63%, respectively. However, in the more common type of early-stage drug discovery setting, in which no structure of a ligand-target complex is known and for which a larger search space is defined, rDock performed similarly to Vina, with a low success rate of  approximately 27%. Vina was found to have bias for ligands with certain physicochemical properties, whereas rDock performs similarly for all ligand properties.

There are no efficient drugs for its treatment. However, previous studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have 96% and 86.5% similarities in cysteine proteases (3CL(pro)) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)) sequences, respectively. This resemblance could be important in the search for drug candidates with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: This paper is a compilation of natural products that inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) and PL(pro) and, concomitantly, reduce inflammation and/or modulate the immune system as a perspective strategy for COVID-19 drug discovery. It also presents in silico studies performed on these selected natural products using SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) and PL(pro) as targets to propose a list of hit compounds. METHODS: The plant metabolites were selected in the literature based on their biological activities on SARS-CoV proteins, inflammatory mediators, and immune response. The consensus docking analysis was performed using four different packages. RESULTS: Seventy-nine compounds reported in the literature with inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV proteins were reported as anti-inflammatory agents. Fourteen of them showed immunomodulatory effects in previous studies. Five and six of these compounds showed significant in silico consensus as drug candidates that can inhibit PL(pro) and 3CL(pro), respectively. Our findings corroborated recent results reported on anti-SARS-CoV-2 in the literature. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that amentoflavone, rubranoside B, savinin, psoralidin, hirsutenone, and papyriflavonol A are good drug candidates for the search of antibiotics against COVID-19.",Current medicinal chemistry,2022

In this work, we present two new methods, which aim to improve de novo design outcomes using (1) biasing algorithms to prioritize selection and/or acceptance of fragments and torsions during growth, and (2) parallel-based clustering and pruning algorithms to remove duplicate molecules as candidate fragment are added. Large-scale testing encompassing thousands of simulations were employed to interrogate the methods in terms of multiple metrics which include numbers of duplicate molecules generated, pairwise-similarity, focused library reconstruction rates, fragment and torsion frequencies, fragment and torsion rank scores, interaction energy and drug-likeness scores, and 3D pose comparisons. The biasing algorithms, particularly those that include fragment and torsion components simultaneously, led to molecules that more closely mimicked the distributions of fragments and torsions found in drug-like libraries. The new parallel-based clustering and pruning algorithms, compared with the existing serial approach, also led to larger ensembles comprised of topologically unique molecules with much greater efficiency by removing redundant growth paths.",Journal of computational chemistry,2025

A significant amount of applied nitrogen in agricultural soils is lost as nitrous oxide (N(2)O) in the environment due to the microbial denitrification process. The widely distributed fungus Fusarium oxysporum is a major denitrifier in agricultural soils and its denitrification activity could be targeted to reduce nitrogen loss in the form of N(2)O from agricultural soils. Here, we report the discovery of first small molecule inhibitors of copper nitrite reductase (NirK) from F. oxysporum, which is a key enzyme in the fungal denitrification process. The inhibitors were discovered by a hierarchical in silico screening approach consisting of pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking. In vitro evaluation of F. oxysporum NirK activity revealed several pyrimidone and triazinone based compounds with potency in the low micromolar range.

We aimed to evaluate a family of pharmaco-chaperones to act as modulators that provide dynamic interventions and the multi-target capacity (native state, cytotoxic oligomers, protofilaments and fibrils of hIAPP(1-37)) required to meet the treatment challenges of diabetes. We used a cross-functional approach that combines in silico and in vitro biochemical and biophysical methods to study the hIAPP(1-37) aggregation-oligomerization process as to reveal novel potential anti-diabetic drugs. The family of pharmaco-chaperones are modulators of the oligomerization and fibre formation of hIAPP(1-37). When they interact with the amino acid in the amyloid-like steric zipper zone, they inhibit and/or delay the aggregation-oligomerization pathway by binding and stabilizing several amyloid structures of hIAPP(1-37). Moreover, they can protect cerebellar granule cells (CGC) from the cytotoxicity produced by the hIAPP(1-37) oligomers. The modulation of proteostasis by the family of pharmaco-chaperones A-F is a promising potential approach to limit the onset and progression of diabetes and its comorbidities.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2018

Important therapeutic interventions have been reached since the discovery of the disease. However, its resurgence urges the need for new approaches against this malady. The NS4B receptor is one of the important proteins for Hepatitis C Virus RNA replication that acts by mediating different viral properties. In this work, we opt to explore the relationships between the molecular structures of biologically tested NS4B inhibitors and their corresponding inhibitory activities to assist the design of novel and potent NS4B inhibitors. For that, a set of 115 indol-2-ylpyridine-3-sulfonamides (IPSA) compounds with inhibitory activity against NS4B is used. A hybrid genetic algorithm combined with multiple linear regressions (GA-MLR) was implemented to construct a predictive model. This model was further used and applied to a set of compounds that were generated based on a pharmacophore modeling study combined with virtual screening to identify structurally similar lead compounds. Multiple filtrations were implemented for selecting potent hits. The selected hits exhibited advantageous molecular features, allowing for favorable inhibitory activity against HCV. The results showed that 7 out of 1285 screened compounds, were selected as potent candidate hits where Zinc14822482 exhibits the best predicted potency and pharmacophore features. The predictive pharmacokinetic analysis further justified the compounds as potential hit molecules, prompting their recommendation for a confirmatory biological evaluation.

SIRT1 in association with the p53 protein can regulate crucial cell processes such as glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, DNA repair, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation through the process of deacetylation. When SIRT1 deacetylates p53, it loses its tumor suppression property. To promote apoptosis and decrease cell proliferation by inhibiting SIRT1 protein and ultimately raising the acetylation of p53 to regain its tumor suppressor function. Though we have many SIRT1 protein inhibitors, they exhibited off-target effects and inefficiency at the clinical trial stage. This study has been executed to identify more potentially effective and reliable SIRT1 inhibitors that can perform better than the existing options. To do so, pharmacophore-based screening of compound libraries followed by virtual screening, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and toxicity studies were conducted which gave 42 compounds to evaluate further. Subsequently, exhaustive molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation predicted four potential hits to inhibit the SIRT1 protein better than the reference compound. Further studies such as principal components analysis, free energy landscape, and estimation of binding free energy were done which concluded Hit4 (PubChem ID: 55753455) to be a novel and potent SIRT1 small molecule inhibitor among the others.

Our reported PDE4 inhibitors FCPR16 and FCPR03 have displayed neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells, but have very low oral bioavailability. To access analogues with improved bioavailability, a new series of arylbenzylamine derivatives were designed and synthesized. Preliminary screening results of the series showed that arylbenzylamine derivatives bearing a pyridin-3-amine side chain displayed good inhibitory activities against human PDE4B1 and PDE4D7 isoforms. Moreover, kinetic studies revealed that the most potent compounds 11r and 11s with mid-nanomolar IC(50) values partially bind to PDE4B1 (I(max) = 93% and 90% respectively). Molecular docking results revealed the possible interactions of compounds 11r and 11s with upstream conserved region 2 (UCR2) of PDE4B1, which illuminate possible reasons for their partial inhibition against PDE4. Using a cell-based model of PD, compounds 11r and 11s were found to alleviate cellular apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells induced by MPP(+) (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium), with this neuroprotective effect being greater than PDE4 inhibitor rolipram.

To date, there is no specific therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Flavonoids, especially rutin, have attracted considerable interest as a prospective SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitor. In this study, a database containing 2017 flavone analogs was prepared and screened against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) using the molecular docking technique. According to the results, 371 flavone analogs exhibited good potency towards M(pro) with docking scores less than -9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations, were performed for the top potent analogs in complex with M(pro). Compared to rutin, PubChem-129-716-607 and PubChem-885-071-27 showed better binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) over 150 ns MD course with DeltaG(binding) values of -69.0 and -68.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Structural and energetic analyses demonstrated high stability of the identified analogs inside the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active site over 150 ns MD simulations. The oral bioavailabilities of probable SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors were underpinned using drug-likeness parameters. A comparison of the binding affinities demonstrated that the MM/GBSA binding energies of the identified flavone analogs were approximately three and two times less than those of lopinavir and baicalein, respectively.

27662181,Enhancing Virtual Screening Performance of Protein Kinases with Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,"In silico virtual screening (VS) is a powerful hit identification technique used in drug discovery projects that aims to effectively distinguish true actives from inactive or decoy molecules. To better capture the dynamic behavior of protein drug targets, compound databases may be screened against an ensemble of protein conformations, which may be experimentally determined or generated computationally, i.e. via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Several studies have shown that conformations generated by MD are useful in identifying novel hit compounds, in part because structural rearrangements sampled during MD can provide novel targetable areas. However, it remains difficult to predict a priori when an MD conformation will outperform a VS against the crystal structure alone. Here, we assess whether MD conformations result in improved VS performance for six protein kinases. MD conformations are selected using three different methods, and their VS performances are compared to the corresponding crystal structures. Additionally, these conformations are used to train ensembles, and their VS performance is compared to the individual MD conformations and the corresponding crystal structures using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) metrics. We show that performing MD results in at least one conformation that offers better VS performance than the crystal structure, and that, while it is possible to train ensembles to outperform the crystal structure alone, the extent of this enhancement is target dependent. Lastly, we show that the optimal structural selection method is also target dependent and recommend optimizing virtual screens on a kinase-by-kinase basis to improve the likelihood of success.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2016

In this work, a two-dimensional analytical system was developed to screen antagonists of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) from M. tenacissima. A fraction was retained on the EGFR cell membrane chromatography (CMC) column, separated and identified as tenacissoside G (TG), tenacissoside H (TH) and tenacissoside I (TI) by two-dimensional HPLC-IT-TOF-MS. Molecular docking and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were carried out to assess the activity of TS (including TG, TH and TI). Molecular docking results showed that the binding mode of TS on EGFR is similar to that of gefitinib.

32268871,Discovery of a Highly Potent and Novel Gambogic Acid Derivative as an Anticancer Drug Candidate.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gambogic Acid (GA), a promising anti-cancer agent isolated from the resin of Garcinia species in Southeast Asia, exhibits high potency in inhibiting a wide variety of cancer cells' growth. Moreover, the fact that it is amenable to chemical modification makes GA an attractive molecule for the development of anti-cancer agents. METHODS: Gambogic acid-3-(4-pyrimidinyloxy) propyl ester (compound 4) was derived from the reaction between 4-hydroxypropoxy pyrimidine and GA. Its structure was elucidated by comprehensive analysis of ESIMS, HRESIMS, 1 D NMR data. Anti-tumor activities of compound 4 and GA in vitro against HepG-2, A549 and MCF-7 cells were investigated by MTT assay. FITC/PI dye was used to test apoptosis. The binding affinity difference of compound 4 and GA binding to IKKbeta was studied by using Discovery Studio 2016. RESULTS: Compound 4 was successfully synthesized and showed strong inhibitory effects on HepG-2, A549 and MCF-7 cells lines with an IC(50) value of 1.49+/-0.11, 1.37+/-0.06 and 0.64+/-0.16muM, respectively. Molecular docking study demonstrated that four more hydrogen bonds were established between IKKbeta and compound 4, compared with GA. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that compound 4 showed significant effects in inducing apoptosis. Further molecular docking study indicated that the introduction of pyrimidine could improve GA's binding affinity to IKKbeta. Compound 4 may serve as a potential lead compound for the development of new anti-cancer drugs.",Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,2021
27243809,A Novel Phenanthridionone Based Scaffold As a Potential Inhibitor of the BRD2 Bromodomain: Crystal Structure of the Complex.,"Bromodomain containing proteins recognize the level of histone acetylation and regulate epigenetically controlled processes like gene transcription and chromatin modification. The BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) family proteins, which are transcriptional co-regulators, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and defects in embryonic stem cell differentiation. Inhibitors selectively targeting the BET bromodomains can pave the path for new drug discovery against several forms of major diseases. By a rational structure-based approach, we have identified a new inhibitor (NSC127133) of the second bromodomain (BD2) of the BET family protein BRD2 using the NCI Diversity Set III library. A high-resolution crystal structure of the BRD2-BD2 in complex with this compound and in apo- form is refined to 0.91 and 0.94 A, respectively. The compound, which is a phenanthridinone derivative, binds well to the acetyl-lysine binding pocket of BD2 and displays significant hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. Moreover, the atomic resolution data obtained in this study allowed us to visualize certain structural features of BD2 which remained unobserved so far. We propose that the discovered compound may be a potential molecule to develop a new library for inhibiting the BRD2-BD2 function.",PloS one,2016
28606047,"Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Vanillin Hydroxamic Acid Derivatives as Novel Peptide Deformylase Inhibitors.","BACKGROUND: Infectious disease is increasingly hampering human health, which challenge the discovery of new antibacterial target. Peptide deformylase (PDF), a metalloenzyme responsible for catalyzing the removal of the N-formyl group from nascent proteins, was considered as an important target in antibacterial drug discovery. OBJECTIVE: Reported here are the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of vanillin hydroxamic acid derivatives. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of the structure-activity relationships lead to the discovery of compound 8, which exhibits promising antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus oryzae, and Aspergillus foetidus with the MIC value of 0.32 microg/ml, 0.32 microg/ml, 0.16 microg/ml and 0.16 microg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, molecular docking study was applied to elucidate binding interaction between compound 8 and PDF, which indicate that compound 8 not only shares the same binding pocket with actinonin, but also has a similar binding pattern. In silico pharmacokinetic and toxicity prediction studies also suggested that compound 8 has a relatively high drug score of 0.80, and has no risk of toxicity.

Initially, ROC-guided machine learning was employed to obtain almost 13182 compounds from three libraries. After conducting virtual screening to assess the affinity of 2621 acquired compounds, cluster analysis and bonding model analysis led to the discovery of five hit compounds. Additionally, antibacterial activity assays and time-killing kinetics revealed that T3995 could eliminate Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC9732, with MIC values of 32 and 2 mug/mL. Further morphology and FtsZ polymerization assays indicated that T3995 could be an antimicrobial inhibitor by targeting FtsZ protein. Moreover, hemolytic toxicity evaluation demonstrated that T3995 is safe at or below 16 ug/mL concentration. Additionally, bonding model analysis explained how the compound T3995 can display antimicrobial activity by targeting the FtsZ protein.

34242036,Structure-Based de Novo Molecular Generator Combined with Artificial Intelligence and Docking Simulations.,"Recently, molecular generation models based on deep learning have attracted significant attention in drug discovery. However, most existing molecular generation models have serious limitations in the context of drug design wherein they do not sufficiently consider the effect of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the target protein in the generation process. In this study, we developed a new deep learning-based molecular generator, SBMolGen, that integrates a recurrent neural network, a Monte Carlo tree search, and docking simulations. The results of an evaluation using four target proteins (two kinases and two G protein-coupled receptors) showed that the generated molecules had a better binding affinity score (docking score) than the known active compounds, and the generated molecules possessed a broader chemical space distribution. SBMolGen not only generates novel binding active molecules but also presents 3D docking poses with target proteins, which will be useful in subsequent drug design.

28097765,A False-Positive Screening Hit in Fragment-Based Lead Discovery: Watch out for the Red Herring.,"With the rising popularity of fragment-based approaches in drug development, more and more attention has to be devoted to the detection of false-positive screening results. In particular, the small size and low affinity of fragments drives screening techniques to their limit. The pursuit of a false-positive hit can cause significant loss of time and resources. Here, we present an instructive and intriguing investigation into the origin of misleading assay results for a fragment that emerged as the most potent binder for the aspartic protease endothiapepsin (EP) across multiple screening assays. This molecule shows its biological effect mainly after conversion into another entity through a reaction cascade that involves major rearrangements of its heterocyclic scaffold. The formed ligand binds EP through an induced-fit mechanism involving remarkable electrostatic interactions.

31151320,"In Silico Identification of Potential Inhibitor Against a Fungal Histone Deacetylase, RPD3 from Magnaporthe Oryzae.","Histone acetylation and deacetylation play an essential role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are a group of zinc-binding metalloenzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl moieties from lysine residues from histone tails. These enzymes are well known for their wide spread biological effects in eukaryotes. In rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, MoRPD3 (an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpd3) was shown to be required for growth and development. Thus in this study, the class I HDAC, MoRpd3 is considered as a potential drug target, and its 3D structure was modelled and validated. Based on the model, a total of 1880 compounds were virtually screened (molecular docking) against MoRpd3 and the activities of the compounds were assessed by docking scores. The in silico screening suggested that [2-[[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy] methyl] phenyl] boronic acid (-8.7 kcal/mol) and [4-[[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy] methyl] phenyl] boronic acid (-8.5 kcal/mol) are effective in comparison to trichostatin A (-7.9 kcal/mol), a well-known general HDAC inhibitor. The in vitro studies for inhibition of appressorium formation by [2-[[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy] methyl] phenyl] boronic acid has resulted in the maximum inhibition at lower concentrations (1 muM), while the trichostatin A exhibited similar levels of inhibition at 1.5 muM. These findings thus suggest that 3D quantitative structure activity relationship studies on [2-[[4-(2-methoxyethyl) phenoxy] methyl] phenyl] boronic acid compound can further guide the design of more potential and specific HDAC inhibitors.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019

In this study, we aimed to establish a computational method for quantifying the enzyme-inducing potencies of different compounds via their ability to activate PXR, for the application in drug discovery and development. To achieve this purpose, we developed a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) for predicting enzyme-inducing potencies, based on computer-ligand docking to multiple PXR protein structures sampled from the trajectory of a molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular mechanics-generalized born/surface area scores representing the ligand-protein-binding free energies were calculated for each ligand. As a result, the predicted enzyme-inducing potencies for compounds generated by the CoMFA model were in good agreement with the experimental values. Finally, we concluded that this 3D-QSAR model has the potential to predict the enzyme-inducing potencies of novel compounds with high precision and therefore has valuable applications in the early stages of the drug discovery process.",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2015

32476574,"Virtual screening-driven drug discovery of SARS-CoV2 enzyme inhibitors targeting viral attachment, replication, post-translational modification and host immunity evasion infection mechanisms.","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, the causative agent of the pandemic disease COVID-19, emerged in December 2019 forcing lockdown of communities in many countries. The absence of specific drugs and vaccines, the rapid transmission of the virus, and the increasing number of deaths worldwide necessitated the discovery of new substances for anti-COVID-19 drug development. With the aid of bioinformatics and computational modelling, ninety seven antiviral secondary metabolites from fungi were docked onto five SARS-CoV2 enzymes involved in viral attachment, replication, post-translational modification, and host immunity evasion infection mechanisms followed by molecular dynamics simulation and in silico ADMET prediction (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) of the hit compounds. Thus, three fumiquinazoline alkaloids scedapin C (15), quinadoline B (19) and norquinadoline A (20), the polyketide isochaetochromin D1 (8), and the terpenoid 11a-dehydroxyisoterreulactone A (11) exhibited high binding affinities on the target proteins, papain-like protease (PLpro), chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 15 (nsp15), and the spike binding domain to GRP78. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to optimize the interaction and investigate the stability of the top-scoring ligands in complex with the five target proteins. All tested complexes were found to have dynamic stability. Of the five top-scoring metabolites, quinadoline B (19) was predicted to confer favorable ADMET values, high gastrointestinal absorptive probability and poor blood-brain barrier crossing capacities.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

39455591,Structural and free energy landscape analysis for the discovery of antiviral compounds targeting the cap-binding domain of influenza polymerase PB2.,"Influenza poses a significant threat to global health, with the ability to cause severe epidemics and pandemics. The polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) of the influenza virus plays a crucial role in the viral replication process, making the CAP-binding domain of PB2 an attractive target for antiviral drug development. This study aimed to identify and evaluate potential inhibitors of the influenza polymerase PB2 CAP-binding domain using computational drug discovery methods. We employed a comprehensive computational approach involving virtual screening, molecular docking, and 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Compounds were selected from the Diverse lib database and assessed for their binding affinity and stability in interaction with the PB2 CAP-binding domain. The study utilized the generalized amber force field (GAFF) for MD simulations to further evaluate the dynamic behaviour and stability of the interactions. Among the screened compounds, compounds 1, 3, and 4 showed promising binding affinities. Compound 4 demonstrated the highest binding stability and the most favourable free energy profile, indicating strong and consistent interaction with the target domain. Compound 3 displayed moderate stability with dynamic conformational changes, while Compound 1 maintained robust interactions throughout the simulations. Comparative analyses of these compounds against a control compound highlighted their potential efficacy. Compound 4 emerged as the most promising inhibitor, with substantial stability and strong binding affinity to the PB2 CAP-binding domain. These findings suggest that compound 4, along with compounds 1 and 3, holds the potential for further development into effective antiviral agents against influenza.

39150579,FitScore: a fast machine learning-based score for 3D virtual screening enrichment.,"Enhancing virtual screening enrichment has become an urgent problem in computational chemistry, driven by increasingly large databases of commercially available compounds, without a commensurate drop in in vitro screening costs. Docking these large databases is possible with cloud-scale computing. However, rapid docking necessitates compromises in scoring, often leading to poor enrichment and an abundance of false positives in docking results. This work describes a new scoring function composed of two parts - a knowledge-based component that predicts the probability of a particular atom type being in a particular receptor environment, and a tunable weight matrix that converts the probability predictions into a dimensionless score suitable for virtual screening enrichment. This score, the FitScore, represents the compatibility between the ligand and the binding site and is capable of a high degree of enrichment across standardized docking test sets.",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2024

Intriguingly, these channels are pivotal therapeutic targets with limited clinical pharmacology. In silico methods offer an unprecedented opportunity for discovering new lead compounds targeting thermoTRP channels with improved pharmacological activity and therapeutic index. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the progress on thermoTRP channel pharmacology because of (i) advances in solving their atomic structure using cryo-electron microscopy and, (ii) progress on computational techniques including homology modeling, molecular docking, virtual screening, molecular dynamics, ADME/Tox and artificial intelligence. Together, they have increased the number of lead compounds with clinical potential to treat a variety of pathologies. We used original and review articles from Pubmed (1997-2020), as well as the clinicaltrials.gov database, containing the terms thermoTRP, artificial intelligence, docking, and molecular dynamics.

Here, we use computational and experimental methods to identify and systematically characterize the kinase cross-pharmacology of representative HSP90 inhibitors. We demonstrate that the resorcinol clinical candidates ganetespib and, to a lesser extent, luminespib, display unique off-target kinase pharmacology as compared with other HSP90 inhibitors. We also demonstrate that polypharmacology evolved during the optimization to discover luminespib and that the hit, leads, and clinical candidate all have different polypharmacological profiles. We therefore recommend the computational and experimental characterization of polypharmacology earlier in drug discovery projects to unlock new multi-target drug design opportunities.",Cell chemical biology,2021
34378011,Drug repositioning based on the heterogeneous information fusion graph convolutional network.,"In silico reuse of old drugs (also known as drug repositioning) to treat common and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition because it involves the use of de-risked drugs, with potentially lower overall development costs and shorter development timelines. Therefore, there is a pressing need for computational drug repurposing methodologies to facilitate drug discovery. In this study, we propose a new method, called DRHGCN (Drug Repositioning based on the Heterogeneous information fusion Graph Convolutional Network), to discover potential drugs for a certain disease. To make full use of different topology information in different domains (i.e. drug-drug similarity, disease-disease similarity and drug-disease association networks), we first design inter- and intra-domain feature extraction modules by applying graph convolution operations to the networks to learn the embedding of drugs and diseases, instead of simply integrating the three networks into a heterogeneous network. Afterwards, we parallelly fuse the inter- and intra-domain embeddings to obtain the more representative embeddings of drug and disease. Lastly, we introduce a layer attention mechanism to combine embeddings from multiple graph convolution layers for further improving the prediction performance. We find that DRHGCN achieves high performance (the average AUROC is 0.934 and the average AUPR is 0.539) in four benchmark datasets, outperforming the current approaches. Importantly, we conducted molecular docking experiments on DRHGCN-predicted candidate drugs, providing several novel approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. benzatropine) and Parkinson's disease (e.g. trihexyphenidyl and haloperidol).",Briefings in bioinformatics,2021

35119780,Structural insights into the substrate-binding site of main protease for the structure-based COVID-19 drug discovery.,"An attractive drug target to combat COVID-19 is the main protease (M(pro) ) because of its key role in the viral life cycle by processing the polyproteins translated from the viral RNA. Studying the crystal structures of the protease is important to enhance our understanding of its mechanism of action at the atomic-level resolution, and consequently may provide crucial structural insights for structure-based drug discovery. In the current study, we report a comparative structural analysis of the M(pro) substrate binding site for both apo and holo forms to identify key interacting residues and conserved water molecules during the ligand-binding process. It is shown that in addition to the catalytic dyad residues (His41 and Cys145), the oxyanion hole residues (Asn142-Ser144) and residues His164-Glu166 form essential parts of the substrate-binding pocket of the protease in the binding process. Furthermore, we address the issue of the substrate-binding pocket flexibility and show that two adjacent loops in the M(pro) structures (residues Thr45-Met49 and Arg188-Ala191) with high flexibility can regulate the binding cavity' accessibility for different ligand sizes. Moreover, we discuss in detail the various structural and functional roles of several important conserved and mobile water molecules within and around the binding site in the proper enzymatic function of M(pro) . We also present a new docking protocol in the framework of the ensemble docking strategy. The performance of the docking protocol has been evaluated in predicting ligand binding pose and affinity ranking for two popular docking programs; AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina. Our docking results suggest that the top-ranked poses of the most populated clusters obtained by AutoDock Vina are the most important representative docking runs that show a very good performance in estimating experimental binding poses and affinity ranking.",Proteins,2022
33549806,The rise of covalent proteolysis targeting chimeras.,"Targeted protein degradation offers several advantages over direct inhibition of protein activity and is gaining increasing interest in chemical biology and drug discovery. Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) in particular are enjoying widespread application. However, PROTACs, which recruit an E3 ligase for degradation of a target protein, still suffer from certain challenges. These include a limited selection for E3 ligases on the one hand and the requirement for potent target binding on the other hand. Both issues restrict the target scope available for PROTACs. Degraders that covalently engage the target protein or the E3 ligase can potentially expand the pool of both targets and E3 ligases. Moreover, they may offer additional advantages by improving the kinetics of ternary complex formation or by endowing additional selectivity to the degrader. Here, we review the recent progress in the emerging field of covalent PROTACs.",Current opinion in chemical biology,2021
30544037,Discovery of potent and selective inhibitors of the Escherichia coli M1-aminopeptidase via multicomponent solid-phase synthesis of tetrazole-peptidomimetics.,"The Escherichia coli neutral M1-aminopeptidase (ePepN) is a novel target identified for the development of antimicrobials. Here we describe a solid-phase multicomponent approach which enabled the discovery of potent ePepN inhibitors. The on-resin protocol, developed in the frame of the Distributed Drug Discovery (D3) program, comprises the implementation of parallel Ugi-azide four-component reactions with resin-bound amino acids, thus leading to the rapid preparation of a focused library of tetrazole-peptidomimetics (TPMs) suitable for biological screening. By dose-response studies, three compounds were identified as potent and selective ePepN inhibitors, as little inhibitory effect was exhibited for the porcine ortholog aminopeptidase. The study allowed for the identification of the key structural features required for a high ePepN inhibitory activity. The most potent and selective inhibitor (TPM 11) showed a non-competitive inhibition profile of ePepN. We predicted that both diastereomers of compound TPM 11 bind to a site distinct from that occupied by the substrate. Theoretical models suggested that TPM 11 has an alternative inhibition mechanism that doesn't involve Zn coordination. On the other hand, the activity landscape analysis provided a rationale for our findings. Of note, compound TMP 2 showed in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, none of the three identified inhibitors is a potent haemolytic agent, and only two compounds showed moderate cytotoxic activity toward the murine myeloma P3X63Ag cells. These results point to promising compounds for the future development of rationally designed TPMs as antibacterial agents.",European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019

Due to the spread of multidrug resistance to the marketed antimalarial drugs including the ""magic bullet"" artemisinin, discovery and development of new antimalarial drugs is one of the utmost challenges. Different government and non-government chemical regulatory authorities have recommended the application of non-animal, alternative techniques and in particular, in silico, methods in order to provide information about the basic physicochemical properties as well as the ecological and human health effects of chemicals before they reach into the market for public use.

The quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) along with molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling techniques play a crucial role in the field of drug design. QSAR focuses on the chemical attributes influencing the activity and thereby allows synthesis of selective potential candidate molecules.

In this work, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches comprising ligand- and structure-based methods were explored for predicting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitors. The CADD ligand-based method used a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification model that was built using 5276 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database with SARS-CoV-2 screening data. The best model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of up to 67% for an external and internal validation using test and training sets.

All the MNPs from the virtual screening libraries that were predicted as belonging to class A were selected for the CADD structure-based method. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 494 MNPs selected by the QSAR approach were screened by molecular docking against M(pro) enzyme. A list of virtual screening hits comprising fifteen MNPs was assented by establishing several limits in this CADD approach, and five MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors, a benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromene, notoamide I, emindole SB beta-mannoside, and two bromoindole derivatives.",Marine drugs,2020

It is believed that targeting this viral protein could be key to developing effective COVID-19 prophylactics. Using in silico techniques, this study sought to virtually screen for compounds from the literature that strongly bind and disrupt the stability of the HSPA8-spike protein complex. To evaluate the interactions between the individual proteins and the protein complex attained from protein-protein docking using BioLuminate, molecular docking was performed using the Maestro Schrodinger Suite. The screened small molecules met all bioavailability conditions, Lipinski's and Veber's rules, and the required medicinal chemistry properties. Protein-protein docking of the spike protein and HSPA8 identified the optimal pose with a PIPER cluster size of 65, a PIPER pose energy of -748.301 kcal/mol, and a PIPER pose score of -101.189 kcal/mol. Two small molecules, NSC36398 and NSC281245, showed promising docking scores against the spike protein individually and in a complex with HSPA8. NSC36398 had a docking score of -7.934 kcal/mol and a binding free energy of -39.52 kcal/mol with the viral spike protein and a docking score of -8.029 kcal/mol and binding free energy of -38.61 with the viral protein in complex with HSPA8, respectively.

We evaluated the usefulness of matrix-based descriptors in a retrospective setting and compared them with topological pharmacophore descriptors. Special attention was given to the influence of data pre-processing and the applied similarity metric on the virtual screening performance. Overall, the MB descriptors showed a competitive and complementary performance to other descriptors. A prospective screen of a commercial compound library led to the discovery of a novel natural-product-derived cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor predicted to interact differently with the target protein compared to the query compound ibuprofen. The results of our study motivate the use of matrix-based descriptors for molecular similarity-based virtual screening and scaffold hopping.",Molecular informatics,2017
32822762,New lead discovery of insect growth regulators based on the scaffold hopping strategy.,"Insect growth regulators (IGRs), which can interrupt or inhibit pest life cycles, are low-toxicity pesticides widely used in integrated pest management (IPM). Ecdysone analogues and chitinase inhibitors are familiar IGRs that have attracted considerable attention because of their unique modes of action and low toxicity to non-target organisms. To find new and highly effective candidate IGRs with novel mechanisms, D-08 (N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-2-phenyl-2,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydrocyclohepta[c]pyrazole-5-carboxamide) was chosen as a lead compound, and a series of novel heptacyclic pyrazolamide derivatives were designed and synthesized using the scaffold hopping strategy. The bioassay showed that III-27 (N-(2-methylphenethyl)-1-phenyl-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydrocyclohepta[c]pyrazole-5-carboxamide) had excellent activity against Plutella xylostella. Protein verification and molecular docking indicated that III-27 could act on both the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Ostrinia furnacalis chitinase (Of ChtI) and is a promising new lead IGRs. The interaction mechanism of III-27 with EcR and Of ChtI was then studied by molecular docking. These results provide important guidance for the study of new dual-target IGRs.",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2020
28332573,Discovery of multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors as novel anti-angiogenesis agents.,"Recently, we have identified a biphenyl-aryl urea incorporated with salicylaldoxime (BPS-7) as an anti-angiogenesis agent. Herein, we disclosed a series of novel anti-angiogenesis agents with BPS-7 as lead compound through combining diarylureas with N-pyridin-2-ylcyclopropane carboxamide. Several title compounds exhibited simultaneous inhibition effects against three pro-angiogenic RTKs (VEGFR-2, TIE-2 and EphB4). Some of them displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against human vascular endothelial cell (EA.hy926). In particular, two potent compounds (CDAU-1 and CDAU-2) could be considered as promising anti-angiogenesis agents with triplet inhibition profile. The biological evaluation and molecular docking results indicate that N-pyridin-2-ylcyclopropane carboxamide could serve as a hinge-binding group (HBG) for the discovery of multi-target anti-angiogenesis agents. CDAU-2 also exhibited promising anti-angiogenic potency in a tissue model for angiogenesis.",Scientific reports,2017

33356922,Small molecule stabilization of non-native protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2 N protein as a mechanism of action against COVID-19.,"The outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to affect millions of people around the world. The absence of a globally distributed effective treatment makes the exploration of new mechanisms of action a key step to address this situation. Stabilization of non-native Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) of the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV has been reported as a valid strategy to inhibit viral replication. In this study, the applicability of this unexplored mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed. During our research, we were able to find three inducible interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD, compare them to the previously reported MERS-CoV stabilized dimers, and identify those residues that are responsible for their formation. A drug discovery protocol implemented consisting of docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA enabled us to find several compounds that might be able to exploit this mechanism of action. In addition, a common catechin skeleton was found among many of these molecules, which might be useful for further drug design. We consider that our findings could motivate future research in the fields of drug discovery and design towards the exploitation of this previously unexplored mechanism of action against COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37713334,Discovery of pharmacological agents for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC): molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB).,"Global burden of breast cancer is expected to cross 26 million new cases by 2030. The term 'triple negative breast cancer' (TNBC) refers to lack of expression of hormone receptors (ER, PR and HER2). 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibition promotes breast cancer apoptosis, ferroptosis and inhibits metastases. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation induces cell survival in breast cancer through stimulation of angiogenesis. Therefore, inhibiting NF-B signalling can stop the growth of tumours. In light of these facts, an attempt is made to investigate binding characteristics of LOX inhibitors against 5-LOX (PDB-IDs 3V99 and 6N2W) and NF-kappaB (PDB-IDs 4KIK and 3DO7) through molecular docking, MM-GBSA calculation, molecular dynamic simulations (MDSs) and drug-likeness analysis. The eight lead molecules A169, A156, A162, A154, A102, A240, A86 and A58 were identified. The higher NF-B inhibiting potential of A169 was discovered through the sequential HTVS, SP docking and XP docking study. The hydrophobic interaction of Leu607, Phe610, Gln557 and Asn554 with 3V99 and Cys99, Glu97 and Arg20 of 4KIK is crucial for the inhibition. The LE, LLE and FQ values of A169 suggest their optimal binding with the target. This study strongly suggests the LOX and NF-kappaB inhibitory potential of A169, further lead optimisation and biological validation requires for the confirmations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

31436327,Novel guanosine derivatives against Zika virus polymerase in silico.,"The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, which started in the year 2015, is considered the fastest and most widely spread outbreak reported for this flavivirus. The polymerase domain of the NS5 protein has been targeted in other viral infections and is recognized as a suitable target in ZIKV infection. Different novel modified compounds against ZIKV NS5 have been tested in silico. A few structures have been solved for ZIKV polymerase and deposited in the protein data bank website. Two of these solved structures (with a resolution of less than 1.9  A) are used in this study to test the binding of 74 novel compounds in silico. Molecular docking is used to quantify the binding affinities of ZIKV polymerase and compare it to the hepatitis C virus NS5B. A total of 19 novel compounds revealed results that are either similar to or better than the physiological molecule, guanosine triphosphate. Water molecules are found to facilitate the binding of the compounds to ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structures. The presented 19 novel compounds represent good binders to ZIKV RdRp and could be suitable candidates for developing a new and effective anti-ZIKV polymerase nucleotide inhibitor.",Journal of medical virology,2020
28140519,Structural insights into anticancer activity of D-ring modified estrone derivatives using their lipophilicity in estimation of SAR and molecular docking studies.,"Many forms of breast carcinoma are hormone-dependent and therefore development of novel aromatase inhibitors is of particular interest. Since brain metastases are frequent in patients with advanced breast carcinoma, one of the goals of modern drug development is the discovery of drugs with specific pharmacokinetic profile. High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) is often used to determine lipophilicity of the molecules based on their retention constant. As a predictive analysis, multiple linear regression method was performed to connect pharmacokinetic-dependent parameters with independent physicochemical properties such are: R(M)(0) , TPSA and M(w) of fourteen D-ring modified oestrone derivatives. Additionally, docking studies were performed. Conducted correlation analysis indicates excellent dependence between experimental R(M) parameter values and calculated values of pharmacokinetic parameters. Results show sufficient intestinal absorption of all the investigated molecules as well as moderate volumes of distribution and strong affinity for binding to plasma proteins. Crossing blood-brain barrier is predicted to be successful for 11 compounds. The created quantitative structure activity relationship model represents an excellent predictive tool and enables determination of pharmacokinetic properties of examined compounds. Docking analysis defined molecules I(3) and II(3) to be the best candidates; however, compound II(3) violates the Lipinski rule. It has been concluded that molecules with hydroxyl group at C-3 more effectively pass through blood-brain barrier while structures with benzyloxy groups have stronger interactions with CYP1A19. Molecules II(2) , II(4) , II(6) , and II(7) are regarded as most suitable candidates for further investigation considering their good pharmacokinetic and docking characteristics.

32348219,Applications of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) based Virtual Screening in Drug Design: A Review.,"The scientists, and the researchers around the globe generate tremendous amount of information everyday; for instance, so far more than 74 million molecules are registered in Chemical Abstract Services. According to a recent study, at present we have around 1060 molecules, which are classified as new drug-like molecules. The library of such molecules is now considered as 'dark chemical space' or 'dark chemistry.' Now, in order to explore such hidden molecules scientifically, a good number of live and updated databases (protein, cell, tissues, structure, drugs, etc.) are available today. The synchronization of the three different sciences: 'genomics', proteomics and 'in-silico simulation' will revolutionize the process of drug discovery. The screening of a sizable number of drugs like molecules is a challenge and it must be treated in an efficient manner. Virtual screening (VS) is an important computational tool in the drug discovery process; however, experimental verification of the drugs also equally important for the drug development process. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis is one of the machine learning technique, which is extensively used in VS techniques. QSAR is well-known for its high and fast throughput screening with a satisfactory hit rate. The QSAR model building involves (i) chemo-genomics data collection from a database or literature (ii) Calculation of right descriptors from molecular representation (iii) establishing a relationship (model) between biological activity and the selected descriptors (iv) application of QSAR model to predict the biological property for the molecules. All the hits obtained by the VS technique needs to be experimentally verified. The present mini-review highlights: the web-based machine learning tools, the role of QSAR in VS techniques, successful applications of QSAR based VS leading to the drug discovery and advantages and challenges of QSAR.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2020
31766271,Hits Discovery on the Androgen Receptor: In Silico Approaches to Identify Agonist Compounds.,"The androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that plays a key role in sexual phenotype and neuromuscular development. AR can be modulated by exogenous compounds such as pharmaceuticals or chemicals present in the environment, and particularly by AR agonist compounds that mimic the action of endogenous agonist ligands and whether restore or alter the AR endocrine system functions. The activation of AR must be correctly balanced and identifying potent AR agonist compounds is of high interest to both propose treatments for certain diseases, or to predict the risk related to agonist chemicals exposure. The development of in silico approaches and the publication of structural, affinity and activity data provide a good framework to develop rational AR hits prediction models. Herein, we present a docking and a pharmacophore modeling strategy to help identifying AR agonist compounds. All models were trained on the NR-DBIND that provides high quality binding data on AR and tested on AR-agonist activity assays from the Tox21 initiative. Both methods display high performance on the NR-DBIND set and could serve as starting point for biologists and toxicologists. Yet, the pharmacophore models still need data feeding to be used as large scope undesired effect prediction models.",Cells,2019

29118092,Structure-based discovery of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors.,"The cell fate-determining roles played by members of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) family explain why their dysregulation can promote proliferative diseases, and identify them as potential targets for drug discovery in oncology and beyond. After many years of research, the first efficacious CDK inhibitors have now been registered for clinical use in a defined segment of breast cancer. Research is underway to identify inhibitors with appropriate CDK-inhibitory profiles to recapitulate this success in other disease settings. Here, we review the structural data that illustrate the interactions and properties that confer upon inhibitors affinity and/or selectivity toward different CDK family members.

37688373,Discovery of promising B lymphocyte kinase inhibitors using structure-guided virtual screening.,"Tyrosine-protein kinase BLK, also known as B-cell lymphocyte kinase (BLK), is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is primarily expressed in B-cells. BLK plays a key role in B-cell signaling, particularly in B-cell development and maturation. The increased expression of BLK has been linked to various complex diseases, including autoimmune disorders, and specific malignancies of B cells, such as lymphomas and leukemias. Due to its significant involvement in B-cell signaling, BLK has emerged as a promising target for drug development, offering the potential for developing novel therapeutics to combat these diseases. Small molecule inhibitors of BLK hold great potential for therapeutic intervention; however, discovering potent and selective inhibitors remains challenging. Within this context, natural compounds hold significant potential as a valuable resource for discovering novel inhibitors of BLK. In the current study, a structure-based virtual screening of the IMPPAT 2 library was employed to identify promising candidates with potential as inhibitors of BLK. The control molecule for this study was the known BLK inhibitor, Dasatinib. After a multi-step filtering process, two molecules (Withanolide I and Mexogenin) demonstrated potential against BLK based on their superior binding affinity, ligand efficiency, and specific interaction. Interaction analysis of these compounds revealed several significant interactions with the active site residues of BLK. Both proposed molecules remained bound to the binding pocket of BLK, as indicated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study.

28319380,Evaluation and Characterization of Trk Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Pain: Reliable Binding Affinity Predictions from Theory and Computation.,"Optimization of ligand binding affinity to the target protein of interest is a primary objective in small-molecule drug discovery. Until now, the prediction of binding affinities by computational methods has not been widely applied in the drug discovery process, mainly because of its lack of accuracy and reproducibility as well as the long turnaround times required to obtain results. Herein we report on a collaborative study that compares tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) binding affinity predictions using two recently formulated fast computational approaches, namely, Enhanced Sampling of Molecular dynamics with Approximation of Continuum Solvent (ESMACS) and Thermodynamic Integration with Enhanced Sampling (TIES), to experimentally derived TrkA binding affinities for a set of Pfizer pan-Trk compounds. ESMACS gives precise and reproducible results and is applicable to highly diverse sets of compounds. It also provides detailed chemical insight into the nature of ligand-protein binding. TIES can predict and thus optimize more subtle changes in binding affinities between compounds of similar structure. Individual binding affinities were calculated in a few hours, exhibiting good correlations with the experimental data of 0.79 and 0.88 from the ESMACS and TIES approaches, respectively. The speed, level of accuracy, and precision of the calculations are such that the affinity predictions can be used to rapidly explain the effects of compound modifications on TrkA binding affinity. The methods could therefore be used as tools to guide lead optimization efforts across multiple prospective structurally enabled programs in the drug discovery setting for a wide range of compounds and targets.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2017

To date there are no mesotrypsin-selective pharmacological inhibitors which could serve as tools for deciphering the pathological role of this enzyme, and could potentially form the basis for novel therapeutic strategies targeting mesotrypsin. A virtual screen of the Natural Product Database (NPD) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Drug Database was conducted by high-throughput molecular docking utilizing crystal structures of mesotrypsin. Twelve high-scoring compounds were selected for testing based on lowest free energy docking scores, interaction with key mesotrypsin active site residues, and commercial availability. Diminazene (CID22956468), along with two similar compounds presenting the bis-benzamidine substructure, was validated as a competitive inhibitor of mesotrypsin and other human trypsin isoforms. Diminazene is the most potent small molecule inhibitor of mesotrypsin reported to date with an inhibitory constant (Ki) of 3.6+/-0.3 muM. Diminazene was subsequently co-crystalized with mesotrypsin and the crystal structure was solved and refined to 1.25 A resolution.

Using Chem-CLIP-Frag-Map, we identified several fragments that bind the precursor to oncogenic microRNA-21 (pre-miR-21). Assembly of these fragments provided a specific bioactive compound with improved potency that inhibits pre-miR-21 processing, reducing mature miR-21 levels.

38864340,Revolutionizing GPCR-ligand predictions: DeepGPCR with experimental validation for high-precision drug discovery.,"G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), crucial in various diseases, are targeted of over 40% of approved drugs. However, the reliable acquisition of experimental GPCRs structures is hindered by their lipid-embedded conformations. Traditional protein-ligand interaction models falter in GPCR-drug interactions, caused by limited and low-quality structures. Generalized models, trained on soluble protein-ligand pairs, are also inadequate. To address these issues, we developed two models, DeepGPCR_BC for binary classification and DeepGPCR_RG for affinity prediction. These models use non-structural GPCR-ligand interaction data, leveraging graph convolutional networks and mol2vec techniques to represent binding pockets and ligands as graphs. This approach significantly speeds up predictions while preserving critical physical-chemical and spatial information. In independent tests, DeepGPCR_BC surpassed Autodock Vina and Schrodinger Dock with an area under the curve of 0.72, accuracy of 0.68 and true positive rate of 0.73, whereas DeepGPCR_RG demonstrated a Pearson correlation of 0.39 and root mean squared error of 1.34. We applied these models to screen drug candidates for GPR35 (Q9HC97), yielding promising results with three (F545-1970, K297-0698, S948-0241) out of eight candidates. Furthermore, we also successfully obtained six active inhibitors for GLP-1R.

Despite a structural difference limited to the location of a methyl group in their conformationally rigid pentacyclic core, oleanoloyl vanillamide dramatically outperformed ursoloyl vanillamide in terms of potency (EC(50) = 35 +/- 2 nM for 2b and 5.4 +/- 2.3 muM for 3b). Using molecular docking and dynamics, this difference was translated into distinct accommodation modes at the TRPV1 vanillyl ligand pocket, suggesting a critical role of a C-H pi(phenyl) interaction between the triterpenoid C-29 methyl and Phe591 of TRPV1. Because the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation process of transient receptor channels (TRPs) remain to be fully elucidated, the observation of spatially restricted structure-activity information is of significant relevance to identify the molecular detail of TRPV1 ligand gating.",Journal of natural products,2020

In this study, a workflow combining computational technologies and biological assays were implemented to identify selective BChE inhibitors with new chemical scaffolds. In particular, a pharmacophore model served as a 3D search query to screen three compound collections containing 3.0 million compounds. Molecular docking and cluster analysis were performed to increase the efficiency and accuracy of virtual screening. Finally, 15 compounds were retained for biological investigation. Results revealed that compounds 8 and 18 could potently and highly selectively inhibit BChE activities (IC(50) values < 10 muM on human BChE, selectivity index BChE > 30). These active compounds with novel scaffolds provided us with a good starting point to further design potent and selective BChE inhibitors, which may be beneficial for the treatment of AD.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019

This is especially relevant in the case of designing new medicaments for treatment of central nervous system disorders. In this work, we present a new approach based on the molecular docking and the following electronic properties analysis of ligands' binding poses (electrostatic potential distribution analysis and quantitative topological analysis of the electron density distribution). The proposed protocol significantly increases the success rate of the selective 5-HT(7)R ligands against 5-HT(1A)R selection from the prepared databases (the rise from 33.3% to 77.8% and from 22.7% to 62.5% for training and testing sets, respectively).

38157481,Regression-Based Active Learning for Accessible Acceleration of Ultra-Large Library Docking.,"Structure-based drug discovery is a process for both hit finding and optimization that relies on a validated three-dimensional model of a target biomolecule, used to rationalize the structure-function relationship for this particular target. An ultralarge virtual screening approach has emerged recently for rapid discovery of high-affinity hit compounds, but it requires substantial computational resources. This study shows that active learning with simple linear regression models can accelerate virtual screening, retrieving up to 90% of the top-1% of the docking hit list after docking just 10% of the ligands. The results demonstrate that it is unnecessary to use complex models, such as deep learning approaches, to predict the imprecise results of ligand docking with a low sampling depth. Furthermore, we explore active learning meta-parameters and find that constant batch size models with a simple ensembling method provide the best ligand retrieval rate. Finally, our approach is validated on the ultralarge size virtual screening data set, retrieving 70% of the top-0.05% of ligands after screening only 2% of the library. Altogether, this work provides a computationally accessible approach for accelerated virtual screening that can serve as a blueprint for the future design of low-compute agents for exploration of the chemical space via large-scale accelerated docking. With recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, this method can significantly increase accessibility for the academic community and aid in the rapid discovery of high-affinity hit compounds for various targets.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2024

34426152,Discovery of potent and selective Cdc25 phosphatase inhibitors via rapid assembly and in situ screening of Quinonoid-focused libraries.,"Cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) phosphatase is an attractive target for drug discovery. The rapid assembly and in situ screening of focused combinatorial fragment libraries using efficient modular reactions is a highly robust strategy for discovering bioactive molecules. In this study, we have utilized miniaturized synthesis to generate several quinonoid-focused libraries, by standard CuAAC reaction and HBTU-based amide coupling chemistry. Then the enzyme inhibition screening afforded some potent and selective Cdc25s inhibitors. Compound M5N36 (Cdc25A: IC(50) = 0.15 +/- 0.05 muM; Cdc25B: IC(50) = 0.19 +/- 0.06 muM; Cdc25C: IC(50) = 0.06 +/- 0.04 muM) exhibited higher inhibitory activity than the initial lead NSC663284 (Cdc25A: IC(50) = 0.27 +/- 0.02 muM; Cdc25B: IC(50) = 0.42 +/- 0.01 muM; Cdc25C: IC(50) = 0.23 +/- 0.01 muM). Moreover, M5N36 displayed about three-fold more potent against Cdc25C than Cdc25A and B, indicating that M5N36 could act as a relatively selective Cdc25C inhibitor. Cell viability evaluation, western blotting and molecular simulations provided a mechanistic understanding of the activity of M5N36.

37226724,Molecular Dynamics Simulation-Driven Focused Virtual Screening and Experimental Validation of Inhibitors for MTDH-SND1 Protein-Protein Interaction.,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs), in general, are attractive yet challenging drug targets. As a typical PPI, MTDH-SND1 interaction has recently been reported to be a promising drug target to malignant breast cancer and other cancer types. However, the lack of well-defined deep pockets on the MTDH-SND1 interface makes it a tough target for rational drug discovery attempts. To address this issue, in this study, a long time-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-driven focused screening strategy was proposed and reported. A total of 12 virtual hits were purchased and tested in SPR assay, yielding 10 SND1 binders with micromolar or less affinities. As an example, compound L5, the second best hit with a K(D) of 2.64 muM, was further assayed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, showing an antiproliferation IC(50) value of 57 muM in a CCK8 assay with a dampened interruption between MTDH and SND1 proteins detected by immunofluorescence colocalization imaging. As the most potent small molecule inhibitor in the class so far, our preliminary study combining molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro cellular functional evidence indicates L5 could serve as a lead compound for future optimization or pharmacologic studies, and the MD-driven focused screening strategy could be useful for other PPI drug discovery attempts.",Journal of chemical information and modeling,2023

Unavailability of effective anti-viral drug rendering global threat of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. In this scenario, viral protease enzymes are crucial targets for drug discovery. This extensive study meticulously focused on two viral proteases such as main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), those are essential for viral replication. This review provides a detail overview of the targets (Mpro and PLpro) from a structural and medicinal chemistry point of view, together with recently reported protease inhibitors. An insight into the challenges in the development of effective as well as drug like protease inhibitors is discussed. Peptidomimetic and/or covalent coronavirus protease inhibitors possessed potent and selective active site inhibition but compromised in pharmacokinetic parameters to be a drug/drug like molecule. Lead optimization of non-peptidomimetic and/or low molecular weight compounds may be a better option for oral delivery.

33925237,Multiscale Virtual Screening Optimization for Shotgun Drug Repurposing Using the CANDO Platform.,"Drug repurposing, the practice of utilizing existing drugs for novel clinical indications, has tremendous potential for improving human health outcomes and increasing therapeutic development efficiency. The goal of multi-disease multitarget drug repurposing, also known as shotgun drug repurposing, is to develop platforms that assess the therapeutic potential of each existing drug for every clinical indication. Our Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for shotgun multitarget repurposing implements several pipelines for the large-scale modeling and simulation of interactions between comprehensive libraries of drugs/compounds and protein structures. In these pipelines, each drug is described by an interaction signature that is compared to all other signatures that are subsequently sorted and ranked based on similarity. Pipelines within the platform are benchmarked based on their ability to recover known drugs for all indications in our library, and predictions are generated based on the hypothesis that (novel) drugs with similar signatures may be repurposed for the same indication(s). The drug-protein interactions used to create the drug-proteome signatures may be determined by any screening or docking method, but the primary approach used thus far has been BANDOCK, our in-house bioanalytical or similarity docking protocol. In this study, we calculated drug-proteome interaction signatures using the publicly available molecular docking method Autodock Vina and created hybrid decision tree pipelines that combined our original bio- and chem-informatic approach with the goal of assessing and benchmarking their drug repurposing capabilities and performance. The hybrid decision tree pipeline outperformed the two docking-based pipelines from which it was synthesized, yielding an average indication accuracy of 13.3% at the top10 cutoff (the most stringent), relative to 10.9% and 7.1% for its constituent pipelines, and a random control accuracy of 2.2%. We demonstrate that docking-based virtual screening pipelines have unique performance characteristics and that the CANDO shotgun repurposing paradigm is not dependent on a specific docking method. Our results also provide further evidence that multiple CANDO pipelines can be synthesized to enhance drug repurposing predictive capability relative to their constituent pipelines. Overall, this study indicates that pipelines consisting of varied docking-based signature generation methods can capture unique and useful signals for accurate comparison of drug-proteome interaction signatures, leading to improvements in the benchmarking and predictive performance of the CANDO shotgun drug repurposing platform.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021

Screen the components and targets of the AM-AS compound in the TCMSP and the BATMAN-TCM, and establish a component-target interaction network by Cytoscape 3.7.2. After searching relevant targets of DN in related databases, the common targets of the AM-AS compound and DN were obtained by comparison. Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed through David database. Molecular docking was performed by PyMoL2.3.0 and AutoDock Vina software. After screening, 142 main targets of the AM-AS compound in the treatment of DN have been identified. Target network was established and the topology of PPI network was analyzed. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis shows that these targets are related to apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance, etc. Molecular docking shows that the target proteins have good combinations with the main active components of the AM-AS compound. AM-AS compound may treat DN by acting on VEGFA, TP53, IL-6, TNF, MARK1, etc., and regulate apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, glucose, and lipid metabolism processes. The in vivo study results suggest that AM-AS compound can significantly reduce the FBG level of diabetic rats, increase the level of INS, improve renal functions, reduce urinary proteins, inhibit glycogen deposition, granulocyte infiltration and collagen fiber proliferation in renal tissue, and restrain the progress of DN.

27438814,Lead Discovery of Type II BRAF V600E Inhibitors Targeting the Structurally Validated DFG-Out Conformation Based upon Selected Fragments.,"The success of the first approved kinase inhibitor imatinib has spurred great interest in the development of type II inhibitors targeting the inactive DFG-out conformation, wherein the Phe of the DFG motif at the start of the activation loop points into the ATP binding site. Nevertheless, kinase inhibitors launched so far are heavily biased toward type I inhibitors targeting the active DFG-in conformation, wherein the Phe of the DFG motif flips by approximately 180 degrees relative to the inactive conformation, resulting in Phe and Asp swapping their positions. Data recently obtained with structurally validated type II inhibitors supported the conclusion that type II inhibitors are more selective than type I inhibitors. In our type II BRAF V600E inhibitor lead discovery effort, we identified phenylaminopyrimidine (PAP) and unsymmetrically disubstituted urea as two fragments that are frequently presented in FDA-approved protein kinase inhibitors. We therefore defined PAP and unsymmetrically disubstituted urea as privileged fragments for kinase drug discovery. A pharmacophore for type II inhibitors, 4-phenylaminopyrimidine urea (4-PAPU), was assembled based upon these privileged fragments. Lead compound SI-046 with BRAF V600E inhibitory activity comparable to the template compound sorafenib was in turn obtained through preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. Molecular docking suggested that SI-046 is a bona fide type II kinase inhibitor binding to the structurally validated ""classical DFG-out"" conformation of BRAF V600E. Our privileged fragments-based approach was shown to efficiently deliver a bona fide type II kinase inhibitor lead. In essence, the theme of this article is to showcase the strategy and rationale of our approach.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2016
38062207,Open-ComBind: harnessing unlabeled data for improved binding pose prediction.,"Determination of the bound pose of a ligand is a critical first step in many in silico drug discovery tasks. Molecular docking is the main tool for the prediction of non-covalent binding of a protein and ligand system. Molecular docking pipelines often only utilize the information of one ligand binding to the protein despite the commonly held hypothesis that different ligands share binding interactions when bound to the same receptor. Here we describe Open-ComBind, an easy-to-use, open-source version of the ComBind molecular docking pipeline that leverages information from multiple ligands without known bound structures to enhance pose selection. We first create distributions of feature similarities between ligand pose pairs, comparing near-native poses with all sampled docked poses. These distributions capture the likelihood of observing similar features, such as hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts, in different pose configurations. These similarity distributions are then combined with a per-ligand docking score to enhance overall pose selection by 5% and 4.5% for high-affinity and congeneric series helper ligands, respectively. Open-ComBind reduces the average RMSD of ligands in our benchmark dataset by 9.0%. We provide Open-ComBind as an easy-to-use command line and Python API to increase pose prediction performance at www.github.com/drewnutt/open_combind .",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2023

Because bacteria in biofilms are less amenable to antibiotic treatment, biofilms have been associated with developing antibiotic resistance, a problem that urges developing new therapeutic options and approaches. Interfering with quorum-sensing (QS), an important process of cell-to-cell communication by bacteria in biofilms is a promising strategy to inhibit biofilm formation and development. Here we describe and apply an in silico computational protocol for identifying novel potential inhibitors of quorum-sensing, using CviR-the quorum-sensing receptor from Chromobacterium violaceum-as a model target. This in silico approach combines protein-ligand docking (with 7 different docking programs/scoring functions), receptor-based virtual screening, molecular dynamic simulations, and free energy calculations. Particular emphasis was dedicated to optimizing the discrimination ability between active/inactive molecules in virtual screening tests using a target-specific training set. Overall, the optimized protocol was used to evaluate 66,461 molecules, including those on the ZINC/FDA-Approved database and to the Mu.Ta.Lig Virtual Chemotheca. Multiple promising compounds were identified, yielding good prospects for future experimental validation and for drug repurposing towards QS inhibition.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2021

31885353,"Potential Therapeutic Approaches to Alzheimer's Disease By Bioinformatics, Cheminformatics And Predicted Adme-Tox Tools.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered a severe, irreversible and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Currently, the pharmacological management of AD is based on a few clinically approved acethylcholinesterase (AChE) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligands, with unclear molecular mechanisms and severe side effects. METHODS: Here, we reviewed the most recent bioinformatics, cheminformatics (SAR, drug design, molecular docking, friendly databases, ADME-Tox) and experimental data on relevant structurebiological activity relationships and molecular mechanisms of some natural and synthetic compounds with possible anti-AD effects (inhibitors of AChE, NMDA receptors, beta-secretase, amyloid beta (Abeta), redox metals) or acting on multiple AD targets at once. We considered: (i) in silico supported by experimental studies regarding the pharmacological potential of natural compounds as resveratrol, natural alkaloids, flavonoids isolated from various plants and donepezil, galantamine, rivastagmine and memantine derivatives, (ii) the most important pharmacokinetic descriptors of natural compounds in comparison with donepezil, memantine and galantamine. RESULTS: In silico and experimental methods applied to synthetic compounds led to the identification of new AChE inhibitors, NMDA antagonists, multipotent hybrids targeting different AD processes and metal-organic compounds acting as Abeta inhibitors. Natural compounds appear as multipotent agents, acting on several AD pathways: cholinesterases, NMDA receptors, secretases or Abeta, but their efficiency in vivo and their correct dosage should be determined. CONCLUSION: Bioinformatics, cheminformatics and ADME-Tox methods can be very helpful in the quest for an effective anti-AD treatment, allowing the identification of novel drugs, enhancing the druggability of molecular targets and providing a deeper understanding of AD pathological mechanisms.",Current neuropharmacology,2020

26358369,Targeting Bacterial Cell Wall Peptidoglycan Synthesis by Inhibition of Glycosyltransferase Activity.,"Synthesis of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan requires glycosyltransferase enzymes that transfer the disaccharide-peptide from lipid II onto the growing glycan chain. The polymerization of the glycan chain precedes cross-linking by penicillin-binding proteins and is essential for growth for key bacterial pathogens. As such, bacterial cell wall glycosyltransferases are an attractive target for antibiotic drug discovery. However, significant challenges to the development of inhibitors for these targets include the development of suitable assays and chemical matter that is suited to the nature of the binding site. We developed glycosyltransferase enzymatic activity and binding assays using the natural products moenomycin and vancomycin as model inhibitors. In addition, we designed a library of disaccharide compounds based on the minimum moenomycin fragment with peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase inhibitory activity and based on a more drug-like and synthetically versatile disaccharide building block. A subset of these disaccharide compounds bound and inhibited the glycosyltransferase enzymes, and these compounds could serve as chemical entry points for antibiotic development.",Chemical biology & drug design,2016

37907683,Computational Screening Using a Combination of Ligand-Based Machine Learning and Molecular Docking Methods for the Repurposing of Antivirals Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease.,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of SARS-CoV. Several studies have searched for COVID-19 therapies. The topics of these works ranged from vaccine discovery to natural products targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)), a potential therapeutic target due to its essential role in replication and conserved sequences. However, published research on this target is limited, presenting an opportunity for drug discovery and development. METHOD: This study aims to repurpose 10692 drugs in DrugBank by using ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) machine learning (ML) with Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) to seek potential therapeutics based on M(pro) inhibitors. The top candidate compounds, the native ligand (GC-376) of the M(pro) inhibitor, and the positive control boceprevir were then subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) characterization, drug-likeness prediction, and molecular docking (MD). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was added to provide accurate information about the M(pro) regulatory network. RESULTS: This study identified 3,166 compound candidates inhibiting M(pro). The random forest (RF) molecular access system ML model provided the highest confidence score of 0.95 (bromo-7-nitroindazole) and identified the top 22 candidate compounds. Subjecting the 22 candidate compounds, the native ligand GC-376, and boceprevir to further ADMET property characterization and drug-likeness predictions revealed that one compound had two violations of Lipinski's rule. Additional MD results showed that only five compounds had more negative binding energies than the native ligand (- 12.25 kcal/mol). Among these compounds, CCX-140 exhibited the lowest score of - 13.64 kcal/mol. Through literature analysis, six compound classes with potential activity for M(pro) were discovered. They included benzopyrazole, azole, pyrazolopyrimidine, carboxylic acids and derivatives, benzene and substituted derivatives, and diazine. Four pathologies were also discovered on the basis of the M(pro) PPI network. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated the efficiency of LBVS combined with MD. This combined strategy provided positive evidence showing that the top screened drugs, including CCX-140, which had the lowest MD score, can be reasonably advanced to the in vitro phase. This combined method may accelerate the discovery of therapies for novel or orphan diseases from existing drugs.","Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",2024
